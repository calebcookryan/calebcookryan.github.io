Six species of ectoparasite were recorded, including Myodopsylla insignis, Spinturnix americanus, Cimex adjunctus, Macronyssu scrosbyi, Androlaelap scasalis, and an unknown species of the genus Acanthophthirius. Male M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis had similar prevalence of any ectoparasite (22\% and 23\%, resp.). Female M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis had 2-3 times higher prevalence than did conspecific males (68\% and 44\%, resp.). Prevalence of infection of both genders of young of the year was not different from one another and the highest prevalence of any ectoparasite (M. lucifugus 64\%, M. septentrionalis 72\%) among all bat groups. Ectoparasite prevalence and intensity varied positively with roost group size and negatively with grooming efficacy and energy budgets, suggesting that these variables may be important in ectoparasite community structure.},

Unlike males, female bats in the region are colonial roosters during the summer, which may facilitate ectoparasite transfer.

	abstract = {The literatre on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies on habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most research measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two compoenents of fragmentnation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentattion per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term "fragmentation" should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

Modern field technologies and new molecular methods are now providing opportunities to study aspects of bat biology that were previously inaccessible. Consequently, bat social systems are emerging as far more complex than had been imagined. Variable dispersal patterns, complex olfactory and acoustic communication, flexible context-related interactions, striking cooperative behaviors, and cryptic colony structures in the form of fission-fusion systems have been documented. Bat research can contribute to the understanding of animal sociality, and specifically to important topics in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology, such as dispersal, fission-fusion behavior, group decisionmaking, and cooperation.},

	abstract = {In order to understand why animals are social and how group members interact with each other it is important to know their relatedness. However, few studies have investigated the genealogy in complete social groups of free-living animals with low reproductive skew. This holds particularly true for bats. Although almost all bat species are social, their sociobiology is not well understood. Because they are volant, nocturnal and have a rather cryptic life-style, bats are difficult to observe in the wild. Furthermore females are generally gregarious making genetic parent-offspring assignment a challenging task. We used genetic markers in combination with knowledge about age and colony membership of individually marked bats to construct pedigrees in completely sampled maternity colonies of Bechstein's bats (Myotis bechsteinii). Despite considerable fluctuations in population size, no immigration occurred over 5 years in four colonies living in close proximity. Additionally, confrontation tests showed that females of one maternity colony were able to detect and attempted to prevent the intrusion of foreign females into a roost they occupy. Although colonies were absolutely closed, and 75\% of the colony members lived together with close relatives (rgreater than or equal to=0.25), mean colony relatedness was nearly zero (0.02). Average relatedness therefore is a poor estimator for the potential of kin selection in Bechstein's bat colonies and may be misleading when attempting to understand the social structure of animals living in groups where many members breed. Based on our results we discuss the potential adaptive value of living in closed societies with low reproductive skew.},

	abstract = {Functional specialization, or division of labour (DOL), of parts within organisms and colonies is common in most multi-cellular, colonial and social organisms, but it is far from ubiquitous. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the evolutionary origins of DOL; the basic feature common to all of them is that functional differences can arise easily. These mechanisms cannot explain the many groups of colonial and social animals that exhibit no DOL despite up to 500 million years of evolution. Here, I propose a new hypothesis, based on a multi-level selection theory, which predicts that a reproductive DOL is required to evolve prior to subsequent functional specialization. I test this hypothesis using a data-set consisting of the type of DOL for living and extinct colonial and social animals. The frequency distribution of DOL and the sequence of its acquisition confirm that reproductive specialization evolves prior to functional specialization. A corollary of this hypothesis is observed in colonial, social and also within multi-cellular organisms; those species without a reproductive DOL have a smaller range of internal variation, in terms of the number of polymorphs or cell types, than species with a reproductive DOL.},

We weighed 4264 M. sodalis captured during the autumn swarm- ing and spring emergence periods. Mean spring weights were less than mean autumn weights for males and females in both years. Overwinter weight loss, expressed as a percentage of mean autumn weight, ranged from 15\% to 33\% and was least at the cave that received no human visitation in three of four sex-year combinations. The magnitude of overwinter weight loss differed among caves in three of four tests, but the effect of cave on weight loss was inconsistent between sexes in both years and between years within sex. Percent weight loss was less at the hibernaculum with low visitation (x = 5.5 visits/winter) than at the hibernac- ulum with high visitation (x = 378 visits/winter) in two of four sex-year combinations. In- creases of populations in both disturbed hibernacula suggest M. sodalis is affected by limiting factors other than, or in addition to, human visitation in winter.},

We show, in hibernating bats infected with Geomyces destructans, that impacts of disease on solitary species were lower in smaller populations, whereas in socially gregarious species declines were equally severe in populations spanning four orders of magnitude. However, as these gregarious species declined, we observed decreases in social group size that reduced the likelihood of extinction. In addition, disease impacts in these species increased with humidity and temperature such that the coldest and driest roosts provided initial refuge from disease. These results expand our theoretical framework and provide an empirical basis for determining which host species are likely to be driven extinct while management action is still possible.},

We use an individual-based population model to examine how disruption of normal hibernation or pre-hibernation physiology could lead to the pattern of mortality that has been observed. We present evidence that artificial warming of localized areas within hibernacula could increase survival of WNS-affected bats during winter by lessening the energetic costs of periodic arousals. The model suggests that localized thermal refugia of 28 degrees C could improve survival by up to 75\%, depending on how WNS acts to disrupt energy balance. This approach has yet to be tested, but it could serve as a stopgap measure to slow population declines until a solution is found, or to preserve remnant bat populations if WNS becomes ubiquitous throughout the ranges of affected species.},

However, clustering is also used during heterothermic periods such as hibernation, when heat loss should be minimal because body temperature (T(b)) is near ambient temperature (T(a)). 2. We tested two hypotheses that attempt to explain the thermal benefit of clustering by cave-dwelling bats during hibernation: (i) clustering buffers individuals against fluctuations in T(a) ('thermal inertia hypothesis'), and (ii) clustering minimizes heat loss during energetically expensive arousals and subsequent periods of euthermy ('arousal hypothesis'). 3. We created path models parameterized with data obtained from thermal and digital images of naturally hibernating Myotis sodalis clusters and temperature-sensitive dataloggers placed near each cluster. 4. Akaike weights (omega(i)) indicate the arousal hypothesis has nearly complete support (omega(i) = 0.9999), while the thermal inertia hypothesis has little support (omega(i) = 0.0001). As predicted by the arousal hypothesis, mean T(a) is the strongest predictor of cluster size. Further, after accounting for mean T(a), cluster size is negatively related to variation in T(a). 5. Our results indicate that most of the thermal benefit of clustering during hibernation is from decreased heat loss during brief euthermic periods. Further, our results predict that clustering may lessen mass loss during hibernation in stable environments, may be minimized during hibernation when there are large fluctuations in the thermal environment, and that the propensity to cluster may be negatively related to body condition.},

	abstract = {Many species hibernate to conserve energy during periods of low food and water availability. It has long been assumed that the optimal hibernation strategy involves long, deep bouts of torpor that minimize energy expenditure. However, hibernation has ecological (e.g. decreased predator avoidance) and physiological (e.g. sleep deprivation) costs that must be balanced with energy savings; therefore, individuals possessing sufficient energy reserves may reduce their use of deep torpor. We tested the hypothesis that energy (fat) availability influences temperature selection of two fat-storing bat species during hibernation. We predicted that individuals with small energy reserves would select colder temperatures for hibernation in order to minimize energy expenditure, while individuals with larger energy reserves would choose warmer temperatures to minimize the costs of hibernation. Results from our field experiment indicate that little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) hibernating in warm microclimates were significantly heavier than individuals hibernating in cooler microclimates. To determine if energy availability was mediating this relationship, we limited fatty acid availability with mercaptoacetate (MA) and quantified its effect on torpid metabolic rate (TMR) and thermal preference of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Administration of MA caused a 43\% drop in TMR at 10 degrees C and caused bats to choose significantly colder temperatures for hibernation. Our results suggest that fat-storing bats minimize torpor expression using both physiological and behavioral mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Changes in body mass, fat mass. lean dry mass, and energy content of little brown bats, Myotis bucifugus (LeConte), captured at a cave in southern Vermont, were quantified during the pre-hibernation period in late summer and autumn. Adults of both sexes showed maximum rates of increase in body mass from mid-August to mid-September, during which time the average gain was 2.3 g for males and 2.1 g for females. These gains represent 32.9\% and 29.6\% of the pre-hibernation body masses for adult males and females, respectively. Young-of-the-year of both sexes weighed about I to 2 g less than adults during most of the pre-hibernation period, in mid-September, adult females weighed significantly less than a cohort of adult females captured at a maternity roost on the same date. Adult bats reached their maximum pre-hibernating body mass in mid-September, whereas young bars reached their maximum pre-hibernating body mass one month later. From mid-July to mid-September, we found no significant differences in mean body mass between young males and females, but in mid-October when they entered hibernation, young females weighed significantly more than young males and almost as much as adult females. Young males and females arrived at the swarming-hibernation site in late summer with an average lean body mass and fat index approximately 20\% lower than adults. By early October, young females achieved minimum adult levels of lean dry mass, but by the time they entered hibernation the lean mass of young males was still about 10\% lower than adults. During the pre-hibernation period, lean dry mass and fat mass of all bats were significantly correlated with body mass. Regression equations derived from these data were used to estimate total energy content of bats. The acquisition of maximum fat reserves by M. lucifugus In the pre-hibernation period may be as important for successful reproduction as it is for sustaining hibernation. The Fattest adult males may gain a reproductive advantage if they acquire enough energy reserves to sustain autumn mating and hibernation, and engage in multiple matings during the winter. The fattest females should gain a reproductive advantage by maximizing fat reserves before entering hibernation, and retaining sufficient energy reserves at the end of hibernation to facilitate ovulation. Relatively low survival and reduced fecundity in females at northern latitudes may reflect the relatively low fat reserves deposited by young females in their first autumn.},

Climate influences the biogeography of bats, their access to food, timing of hibernation, reproduction and development, frequency and duration of torpor and rate of energy expenditure. 2. Empirical data on the impact of climate change on bats are a cause for concern as current increases in global temperature are one fifth, or less, of those expected over the next century. 3. We review observed impacts of climate change on bats and identify risk factors allowing species-specific predictions. 4. The impact on species is reviewed in relation to six aspects, namely foraging, roosting, reproduction, biogeography, extreme weather events and indirect effects of climate change. For some aspects of species’ ecology, there are insufficient data available to make accurate assessment of impacts. 5. We identify seven risk factors encompassing three broad aspects: biogeography - small range size, high latitude or high altitude range and a range occupying a geographic area likely to become water stressed; foraging niche - frugivory and species restricted to aerial hawking; dispersal ability - species with restricted dispersal behaviour. 6. We use the European and north-west African bats as a case study to assess the relative risk of climate change to individual species. Risk scores are compared with existing International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation assessments providing further insight into the conservation outlook for individual species. 7. We provide a base for Chiroptera to be incorporated into future frameworks of risk assessment and identify areas that require further research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bats belong to one of the most species-rich orders within the Mammalia. They show a worldwide distribution, a high degree of ecological diversification as well as a high diversity of associated parasites and pathogens. Despite their prominent and unique role, the knowledge of their parasite-host-relationships as well as the mechanisms of co-evolutionary processes are, partly due to strict conservation regulations, scarce.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Juvenile specimens of the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) from a roosting colony in Gladenbach (Hesse, Germany) were examined for their metazoan endo-and ectoparasite infections and pathogens. Morphometric data were recorded and the individuals were checked for Lyssavirus-specific antigen using a direct immunofluorescence test. For unambiguous species identification, the bats were analysed by cyt-b sequence comparison.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Myotis myotis were parasitized by the six insect and arachnid ectoparasite species, i.e. Ixodes ricinus, Ischnopsyllus octactenus, Ichoronyssus scutatus, Steatonyssus periblepharus, Spinturnix myoti and Cimex dissimilis. Additionally, the nematode Molinostrongylus alatus and the cestode Vampirolepis balsaci were recorded. Each bat was parasitized by at least four species. The parasites showed partially extreme rates of infection, never recorded before, with more than 1,440 parasites per single host. Ichoronyssus scutatus, Steatonyssus periblepharus, Vampirolepis balsaci and Molinostrongylus alatus are recorded for the first time in Germany. A checklist for Europe is presented containing records of 98 parasite species of 14 Myotis species.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The Myotis myotis from Gladenbach (Hesse, Germany) were parasitized by a diverse parasite fauna with high infestation rates. We assume that in juvenile Myotis the number of parasites is generally higher than in adults due to only later acquired immune competence and behavioural adaptations. Our results revealed new insights into parasite fauna of M. myotis and European bats in general. The finding of endoparasitic cyclophyllidean cestodes that have a two-host lifecycle is, considering the stationary behaviour of the juvenile bats, rather unusual and suggests a non-predatory transmission mechanism (e.g. via autoinfection). A new insight gained from the collated literature was that the European wide composition of the Myotis parasite fauna is dominated by a few specific taxonomic groups in Europe.},

Patterns of torpor, arousal and activity in free-living Greater Horseshoe Bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (Schreber), were investigated during the hibernation period by using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. 2. Torpor bouts varied between 0·1 and 11·8 days, with individual means ranging from 1·3 to 7·4 days. Torpor bout duration decreased with increasing ambient temperature. 3. Activity duration varied from 37 min to 54 h 24 min, with individual means ranging from 2 : 29 to 8 : 58 h. Activity duration increased with ambient temperatures above approximately 10 °C. 4. Ten of 11 bats synchronized their arousals with dusk. The circadian rhythm of one bat showed a free-running pattern over a period of about 5 weeks. Arousals were more highly synchronized, and closer to dusk, in individuals with lower body condition. 5. That bats forage in mild weather is supported by the strong synchronization of arousals with dusk, especially in bats with low body condition. 6. Patterns of torpor and subsequent activity are consistent with predictions that torpor lasts until a critical metabolic or water imbalance is achieved. Because metabolism and water loss are temperature-dependent, torpor bout duration decreases with increasing temperature. The imbalance is corrected during subsequent activity, which is relatively constant in duration until a temperature threshold of 10 °C, above which increasing levels of foraging lead to longer activity bouts.},

	abstract = {Hibernation has long been known to be an energy bottleneck for temperate-zone bats. As such, considerable research effort has been expended to understand the physiological ecology of bat hibernation and the microclimates necessary for successful hibernation. Still, few long-term datasets of microclimate in bat hibernacula are available, and most descriptions of “optimal” hibernation sites are based on temporally or spatially limited datasets. Here, we summarize a long-term dataset of microclimate data from caves used by hibernating Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) to draw conclusions about our understanding of microclimate selection of hibernating bats more generally. Ambient temperature varied among and within most hibernation microsites across the season of hibernation. Microsites near entrances were strongly and rapidly affected by external climatic conditions, while sites deeper in caves were more weakly related to external temperatures and show a greater lag time in response to those conditions. Comparison of microclimate and concurrent population counts suggests that bats select mid-winter microsites with a wider range of environmental conditions than is often stated; mid-winter survey counts increased between 1983 and 2011 in both cold and warm microsites. This extensive dataset provides some of the most exhaustive evidence yet that not all bats within a species choose (or likely require) microsites with the same microclimatic conditions. We argue that too often researchers and land managers have viewed microclimate selection through the lens of “optimal” conditions, and in doing so, often miss important variation that may actually be preferred by some bats.},

	abstract = {Climate change is one of the major issues facing natural populations and thus a focus of recent research has been to predict the responses of organisms to these changes. Models are becoming more complex and now commonly include physiological traits of the organisms of interest. However, endothermic species have received less attention than have ectotherms in these mechanistic models. Further, it is not clear whether responses of endotherms to climate change are modified by variation in thermoregulatory characteristics associated with phenotypic plasticity and/or adaptation to past selective pressures. Here, we review the empirical data on thermal adaptation and acclimatization in endotherms and discuss how those factors may be important in models of responses to climate change. We begin with a discussion of why thermoregulation and thermal sensitivity at high body temperatures should be co-adapted. Importantly, we show that there is, in fact, considerable variation in the ability of endotherms to tolerate high body temperatures and/or high environmental temperatures, but a better understanding of this variation will likely be critical for predicting responses to future climatic scenarios. Next, we discuss why variation in thermoregulatory characteristics should be considered when modeling the effects of climate change on heterothermic endotherms. Finally, we review some biophysical and biochemical factors that will limit adaptation and acclimation in endotherms. We consider both long-term, directional climate change and short-term (but increasingly common) anomalies in climate such as extreme heat waves and we suggest areas of important future research relating to both our basic understanding of endothermic thermoregulation and the responses of endotherms to climate change.},

We examined variation in the hibernation patterns of free-ranging little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. First, we aimed to test the hypothesis that age, sex and body condition affect expression of torpor and energy expenditure during hibernation. Second, we examined skin temperature to assess whether qualitative differences in the thermal properties of the hibernacula of bats, compared with the burrows of hibernating rodents, might lead to different patterns of torpor and arousal for bats. We also evaluated the impact of carrying transmitters on body condition to help determine the potential impact of telemetry studies. We observed large variation in the duration of torpor bouts within and between individuals but detected no effect of age, sex or body condition on torpor expression or estimates of energy expenditure. We observed the use of shallow torpor in the midst of periodic arousals, which may represent a unique adaptation of bats for conservation of energy during the most costly phase of hibernation. There was no difference in the body condition of hibernating bats outfitted with transmitters compared with that of control bats captured from the same hibernaculum at the same time. This study provides new information on the energetics of hibernation in an under-represented taxon and baseline data important for understanding how white-nose syndrome, a new disease devastating populations of hibernating bats in North America, may alter the expression of hibernation in affected bats.},

A good understanding of the factors which allow the ecological effects of climate change to be effectively anticipated is critical to both the quality of basic science and its application to public policy. We used research performed on mammals to ex- plore scientific approaches to anticipation of climate change effects. We distinguished forecasting models based on correlations from predictive models based on cause-effect relationships. These cate- gories represent extremes along a continuous gradient between pattern description and causal under- standing. We suggest that the constraints to our capacity to anticipate fall into 6 broad categories rooted in the development and application of forecasting and predictive models. These categories help to identify the conditions that allow or prevent projection of the effects of climate change on ecosys- tems. This approach should also help to identify which research avenues will likely be most fruitful.},

We use an individual-based population model to examine how disruption of normal hibernation or pre-hibernation physiology could lead to the pattern of mortality that has been observed. We present evidence that artificial warming of localized areas within hibernacula could increase survival of WNS-affected bats during winter by lessening the energetic costs of periodic arousals. The model suggests that localized thermal refugia of 28 degrees C could improve survival by up to 75\%, depending on how WNS acts to disrupt energy balance. This approach has yet to be tested, but it could serve as a stopgap measure to slow population declines until a solution is found, or to preserve remnant bat populations if WNS becomes ubiquitous throughout the ranges of affected species.},

	abstract = {Phenology refers to the timing of events in the annual cycle of organisms. For temperate-zone mammals, hibernation is one such event, but little is known about its phenology. Hibernation consists of energy-saving torpor bouts interspersed with energetically expensive arousals to normothermic T b, and hibernators should benefit from mechanisms which reduce arousal costs and help them time arousals to coincide with foraging opportunities. In a previous study, we showed that, in contrast to hibernating bats from warmer climates, little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) from central Canada abandon a circadian pattern to arousal in the middle of winter when there is no chance of feeding. Here, we used temperature telemetry to test whether they would re-synchronize arousals with normal foraging time (i.e. sunset) during late winter as the chance of foraging or emergence opportunities improves, and whether they would synchronize arousals with conspecifics, possibly to exploit social thermoregulation. We also used passive transponders to test whether energy reserves and/or sex differences in reproductive timing influence phenology and the sensitivity of emergence timing to environmental cues. In contrast to patterns in mid-winter, after 7 April 2013, bats synchronized arousals with sunset and with conspecifics. Females emerged earlier than males, and females in the best condition emerged first while body condition had no influence on male emergence timing. Both male and female bats appeared to time emergence with falling barometric pressure, a cue that predicts favourable foraging conditions for bats but which, unlike outside temperature, would have been readily detectable by bats inside the hibernaculum. Our results highlight hibernation traits associated with extreme winter energy limitation for insect-eating bats in cold climates and illustrate the influence of reproductive timing and environmental conditions on hibernation energetics and phenology.},

	abstract = {White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a new disease of bats that has devastated populations in eastern North America. Infection with the fungus, Geomyces destructans, is thought to increase the time bats spend out of torpor during hibernation, leading to starvation. Little is known about hibernation in healthy, free-ranging bats and more data are needed to help predict consequences of WNS. Trade-offs presumably exist between the energetic benefits and physiological/ecological costs of torpor, leading to the prediction that the relative importance of spring energy reserves should affect an individual's use of torpor and depletion of energy reserves during winter. Myotis lucifugus mate during fall and winter but females do not become pregnant until after spring emergence. Thus, female reproductive success depends on spring fat reserves while male reproductive success does not. Consequently, females should be "thrifty" in their use of fat compared to males. We measured body condition index (BCI; mass/forearm length) of 432 M. lucifugus in Manitoba, Canada during the winter of 2009/2010. Bats were captured during the fall mating period (n = 200), early hibernation (n = 125), and late hibernation (n = 128). Adult females entered hibernation with greater fat reserves and consumed those reserves more slowly than adult males and young of the year. Consequently, adult females may be more likely than males or young of the year to survive the disruption of energy balance associated with WNS, although surviving females may not have sufficient reserves to support reproduction.},

Increases in host contact rates or births drive seasonal epidemics in some systems, but other factors may occasionally override these influences. White-nose syndrome, caused by the emerging fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans, is spreading across North America and threatens several bat species with extinction. We examined patterns and drivers of seasonal transmission of P. destructans by measuring infection prevalence and pathogen loads in six bat species at 30 sites across the eastern United States. Bats became transiently infected in autumn, and transmission spiked in early winter when bats began hibernating. Nearly all bats in six species became infected by late winter when infection intensity peaked. In summer, despite high contact rates and a birth pulse, most bats cleared infections and prevalence dropped to zero. These data suggest the dominant driver of seasonal transmission dynamics was a change in host physiology, specifically hibernation. Our study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to describe the seasonality of transmission in this emerging wildlife disease. The timing of infection and fungal growth resulted in maximal population impacts, but only moderate rates of spatial spread.},

	abstract = {Social structure, which is a function of the patterns of interactions among individuals, is particularly variable in fission–fusion societies. The underlying factors that drive this variation are poorly understood. Female northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) live in fission–fusion societies where females form preferred associations within groups that vary daily in size and composition as individuals switch roosts. The goal of our study was to test the predictions that preferred associations and social networks of female northern long-eared bats vary with reproductive period and age. We also tested the prediction that preferred relationships persist across years despite movements from summer roosts to winter hibernacula. Network analyses revealed that during gestation, females roosted in smaller groups where they roosted more regularly with fewer individuals than during lactation. This variation may reflect different social strategies to mediate higher energetic costs during lactation. Females of all ages roosted more often with younger individuals, which in turn had more direct and indirect associations than all other age classes. Younger individuals may play a role in maintaining connections between individuals, perhaps as a result of younger individuals being more exploratory. Temporal analyses suggested that relationships can persist for years as some pairs roosted together for multiple summers. We suggest that the dynamic nature of fission–fusion societies is associated with individual strategies to increase fitness relative to individual characteristics, in this case reproductive condition and age.},

	abstract = {Seasonal patterns in pathogen transmission can influence the impact of disease on populations and the speed of spatial spread. Increases in host contact rates or births drive seasonal epidemics in some systems, but other factors may occasionally override these influences. White-nose syndrome, caused by the emerging fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans, is spreading across North America and threatens several bat species with extinction. We examined patterns and drivers of seasonal transmission of P. destructans by measuring infection prevalence and pathogen loads in six bat species at 30 sites across the eastern United States. Bats became transiently infected in autumn, and transmission spiked in early winter when bats began hibernating. Nearly all bats in six species became infected by late winter when infection intensity peaked. In summer, despite high contact rates and a birth pulse, most bats cleared infections and prevalence dropped to zero. These data suggest the dominant driver of seasonal transmission dynamics was a change in host physiology, specifically hibernation. Our study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to describe the seasonality of transmission in this emerging wildlife disease. The timing of infection and fungal growth resulted in maximal population impacts, but only moderate rates of spatial spread.},

It is a common source of bush meat in West Africa and evidence of infection with potentially zoonotic viruses has been found in West African colonies. The species, therefore, is of interest to both ecologists and those interested in public health. Despite this, demographic parameters of the species are unknown. We focused our study primarily on a colony of up to 1,000,000 bats that roost in trees in Accra, Ghana to obtain estimates of birth rate and survival probability. Aging of bats by examination of tooth cementum annuli allowed use of life tables to indicate an annual survival probability for juveniles of 0.43 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.77) and for adults of 0.83 (95\% CI 0.73-0.93). Additionally, an annual adult survival probability of 0.63 (95\% CI 0.27-0.88) was estimated by following 98 radiocollared bats over a year; capture-recapture data were analyzed using multistate models to address the confounding factor of emigration. True survival probabilities may be in between the 2 estimates, because permanent emigration may lead to underestimation in the capture-recapture study, and population decline may lead to overestimation in the life table analysis. Birth rates (0.96 young per female per year, 95\% CI 0.92-0.98) and colony size changes were also estimated. Estimation of these key parameters will allow future analyses of both infection dynamics within, and harvest sustainability of, E. helvum populations.},

We used 16 years (1993-2008) of mark-recapture data to estimate age-specific survival and breeding probabilities of the little brown myotis Myotis lucifugus LeConte in southern New Hampshire, USA. Using Kendall \& Nichols' (1995) full-likelihood approach of the robust design to account for temporary emigration, we tested whether survival and breeding propensity is influenced by regional weather patterns and timing of reproduction. 3. Our results demonstrate that adult female survival of M. lucifugus ranged from 0.63 (95\% CL = 0.56, 0.68) to 0.90 (95\% CL = 0.77, 0.94), and was highest in wet years with high cumulative summer precipitation. First-year survival [range: 0.23 (95\% CL = 0.14, 0.35) to 0.46 (95\% CL = 0.34, 0.57)] was considerably lower than adult survival and depended on pup date of birth, such that young born earlier in the summer (c. late May) had a significantly higher probability of surviving their first year than young born later in the summer (c. mid-July). Similarly, the probability of young females returning to the maternity colony to breed in the summer following their birth year was higher for individuals born earlier in the summer [range: 0.23 (95\% CL = 0.08, 0.50) to 0.53 (95\% CL = 0.30, 0.75)]. 4. The positive influence of early parturition on 1st-year survival and breeding propensity demonstrates significant fitness benefits to reproductive timing in this temperate insectivorous bat. 5. Climatic factors can have important consequences for population dynamics of temperate bats, which may be negatively affected by summer drying patterns associated with global climate change. 6. Understanding long-term demographic trends will be important in the face of a novel disease phenomenon (White-Nose Syndrome) that is associated with massive mortalities in hibernating bat species, including M. lucifugus, in the northeastern United States.},

European bats exemplify the need for successful and cost-effective management for both reasons, often simultaneously. Across Europe, bats are protected, and the concept of Favourable Conservation Status (FCS) is used as a key tool for the assessment and licensing of disruptive actions to populations. However, for efficient decision-making, this assessment requires knowledge on the demographic rates and long-term dynamics of populations. We used capture–mark–recapture to describe demographic rates for the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) at two sites in England and investigate the transition rates between three stages: juveniles, immatures, and breeders. We then use these rates in an individual-based population dynamics model to investigate the expected trajectories for both populations. Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence and scale of temporal variation in this species’ demography. We describe the lengthy prereproductive period (3.5 years) that female Serotines experience. Finally, we show how site-specific variation in demographic rates can produce divergent population trajectories. Effective management of European bat populations can be achieved through the understanding of life histories, and local demographic rates and population dynamics, in order to anticipate the presence of source and sink sites in the landscape. Using the Serotine bat in England, we show that these can be obtained from rigorous and systematic studies of long-term demographic datasets.},

WNS is associated with physiological changes in hibernating bats, leading to increased arousals from hibernation and premature consumption of fat reserves. However, there is evidence of surviving populations of little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) close to where the fungus was first detected nearly ten years ago. We examined the hibernation patterns of a surviving population of little brown myotis and compared them to patterns in populations before the arrival of WNS and populations at the peak of WNS mortality. Despite infection with Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative fungal agent, the remnant population displayed less frequent arousals from torpor and lower torpid body temperatures than bats that died from WNS during the peak of mortality. The hibernation patterns of the remnant population resembled pre-WNS patterns with some modifications. These data show that remnant populations of little brown myotis do not experience the increase in periodic arousals from hibernation typified by bats dying from WNS, despite the presence of the fungal pathogen on their skin. These patterns may reflect the use of colder hibernacula microclimates by WNS survivors, and/or may reflect differences in how these bats respond to the disease.},

It offers several advantages over other metabolic indicators and other cytotoxicity assays. However, as with any bioassay, suitability must be determined for each application and cell model. This review seeks to highlight many of the important considerations involved in assay use and design in addition to the potential pitfalls.},

	abstract = {Plants experience oxidative stress upon exposure to heavy metals that leads to cellular damage. In addition, plants accumulate metal ions that disturb cellular ionic homeostasis. To minimize the detrimental effects of heavy metal exposure and their accumulation, plants have evolved detoxification mechanisms. Such mechanisms are mainly based on chelation and subcellular compartmentalization. Chelation of heavy metals is a ubiquitous detoxification strategy described in wide variety of plants. A principal class of heavy metal chelator known in plants is phytochelatins (PCs), a family of Cys-rich peptides. PCs are synthesized non-translationally from reduced glutathione (GSH) in a transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme phytochelatin synthase (PCS). Therefore, availability of glutathione is very essential for PCs synthesis in plants at least during their exposure to heavy metals. Here, I reviewed on effect of heavy metals exposure to plants and role of GSH and PCs in heavy metal stress tolerance. Further, genetic manipulations of GSH and PCs levels that help plants to ameliorate toxic effects of heavy metals have been presented.},

Co-treatment induces synergistic accumulation of both metals and higher expression of MT-mRNAs in the first few hours. mRNA levels were observed not to completely correlate with MT-protein levels, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation may be involved in MT induction. MT-1 is induced to higher levels than MT-2. Zinc does not induce any MT expression. The lowest level of mRNA was observed for MT-2, induced only by copper.

We investigated if reproductive fitness is enhanced by Ni in the growth medium, and included a treatment involving a relatively high level of Mg to provide a comparison with elevated levels of another metal. Seedlings were grown in a modified Hoagland solution culture in an inert medium of Perlite and were treated with Ni (100. μM), a high concentration of Mg (5. mM), or under control conditions (solution culture without Ni or the addition of high Mg) for 14. months. We documented survival, as well as the proportion of individuals that flowered. We also quantified flower production as an indicator of plant fitness. Survival was not affected by treatment (87-90\% for all treatments), but significantly more Ni-treated plants (63\%) flowered compared with Mg-treated (19\%) or control plants (12\%). In addition, inflorescences per plant, inflorescence length, and number of open flowers per inflorescence were all significantly greater for Ni-treated plants relative to plants from the other treatments. Although high levels of Ni are not essential for growth and reproduction of the species, we suggest that Ni stimulates flowering in A. inflatum and may result in greater fitness for the species on serpentine soils. © 2014 South African Association of Botanists.},

Maximum concentrations occurred during the winter, the highest levels being 1770 mg/litre Cl−, 9550 mg/litre Na+ and 4890 mg/litre Ca++. Since most of the salt was entering the creek as NaCl, this chemical was used in the laboratory to test the drift response of three organisms, Hydropsyche betteni, Cheumatopsyche analis and Gammarus pseudolimnaeus. Pulses of salt up to concentrations of 800 mg/litre Cl− had no effect on their drift patterns. These results were then tested in the field. Several experiments were run in a section of Lutteral Creek which had been longitudinally divided by a metal barrier on each side of which drifts nets were stationed. Levels as high as 750 mg/litre Cl− produced no differences in the drift between the salted and unsalted channels. However, during the last experiment, a pulse of 2165 mg/litre Cl− increased the drift of all organisms in the salted channel. This became apparent only when the concentration had exceeded about 1000 mg/litre.},

Testing with C. dubia was used to evaluate the effect of ambient hardness on Ni toxicity, whereas the larger H. azteca was used to derive lethal body burden information for Ni toxicity. As was expected, acute C. dubia median lethal concentrations (LC50s) for Ni increased with increasing water hardness. The 48‐hLC50s were 81, 148, 261, and 400 μg/L at hardnesses of 50, 113, 161, and 253 mg/L (as CaCO3), respectively. Ceriodaphnia dubia was found to be significantly more sensitive in chronic exposures than other species tested (including other daphnids such as Daphnia magna); chronic toxicity was less dependent on hardness than was acute toxicity. Chronic 20\% effective concentrations (EC20s) were estimated at {\textless}3.8, 4.7, 4.0, and 6.9 μg/L at hardnesses of 50, 113, 161, and 253 mg/L, respectively.

The results indicated that the tolerance of macroinvertebrate species are pollutant-specific, whereas the differences in their susceptibility to toxic conditions due to pollution by several toxicants may be negligibly small. Therefore, the reliability of using biological systems based on the macrobenthos distribution to classify surface waters polluted with a variety of chemical pollutants should be seriously doubted.},

It is the most widely used herbicide and the majority of the literature on phenoxy herbicides pertains to studies with 2,4-D. The basic form of 2,4-D is the acid, but 2,4-D is often formulated as an inorganic salt, amine, or ester through various manufacturing processes and is used in many commercial products. 2,4-D is primarily used as an herbicide in agriculture, forestry, and lawn care practices, with the majority of the total usage in the United States being reported for use as weed control in agriculture. Exposure to it can occur via inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact. Respiratory exposure to 2,4-D is less than 2\% of total exposure, and residual levels in foodstuffs or drinking water are essentially nondetectable or only detected in trace amounts. 2,4-D is rapidly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract following oral exposure, with peak plasma levels being reached in as little as 10 minutes or up to 24 hours depending on the dose and chemical form of 2,4-D. In occupationally exposed humans, dermal absorption was reported to occur rapidly based on the detection of 2,4-D in urine within 4 hours. 2,4-D is highly water-soluble and therefore is widely distributed, but does not accumulate, in the body. It also does not readily cross lipid membranes, and at physiological pH, it exists predominantly in the ionized form. 2,4-D uses active transport systems to enter tissues and cross the blood/brain barrier. The extensive database of metabolic, toxicological, and epidemiological studies on 2,4-D has provided no evidence that 2,4-D poses any health risk to humans when used according to label directions.},

The washing and drying steps result in a substantial reduction of the gel slice volume that, when next swollen in the protease solution, readily absorbs the enzyme, facilitating digestion. The Coomassie blue staining procedure has also been modified by reducing acetic acid and methanol concentrations in the staining solution and by eliminating acetic acid in the destaining solution. The peptides resulting from the in-gel digestion are easily recovered by passive elution, in excellent yields for structural characterization.

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the cytochrome oxidase from beef heart mitochondria. Cytochrome c oxidase is mostly assayed by the spectrophotometric method. The rate of oxidation of ferrocytochrome c is measured by following the decrease in the absorbency of its α-band at 550 mμ. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase may be defined in terms of the first-order velocity constant. The oxidation-reduction components of isolated cytochrome c oxidase are cytochrome a, cytochrome a3, and copper. Cytochrome c oxidase can also be assayed by measuring oxygen uptake either manometrically or polarographically. Two procedures for purifying cytochrome c oxidase from beef heart mitochondria are described. The enzyme obtained by procedure I is less pure based on its activity and spectrum. Preparations of cytochrome oxidase are stored best in 0.25M sucrose (pH 7.0-7.5) at –15° at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The composition of cytochrome oxidase prepared by procedure II is tabulated. Ferrocytochrome c donates electrons directly to cytochrome oxidase. The reaction as measured spectrophotometrically obeys first-order reaction kinetics. Cytochrome oxidase is inhibited by cyanide, azide, hydroxylamine, and sodium sulfide.},

Strong positive correlations between the size of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) layer and extracellular cell-bound proteinase were found for both Streptococcus and Lactobacillus cultures. CONCLUSION: Strong positive linear relationships existed between the EPS size and colony size and the diameter of clear zone and colony size for Streptococcus cultures, whereas weak positive linear relationships were observed for Lactobacillus cultures. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These data are useful to validate the relationship between extracellular proteinase and the EPS size of LAB.

However, the aqueous solubility and soil sorption of this compound can cause problems of toxicity in nontarget organisms. This work investigates the preparation and characterization of nanoparticles composed of chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) to produce an efficient herbicidal formulation that was less toxic and could be used for safer control of weeds in agriculture. The toxicities of the formulations were evaluated using cell culture viability assays and the Allium cepa chromosome aberration test. The herbicidal activity was investigated in cultivations of maize (Zea mays) and mustard (Brassica sp.), and soil sorption of the nanoencapsulated herbicide was measured. The efficiency association of paraquat with the nanoparticles was 62.6±0.7\%. Encapsulation of the herbicide resulted in changes in its diffusion and release as well as its sorption by soil. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays showed that the nanoencapsulated herbicide was less toxic than the pure compound, indicating its potential to control weeds while at the same time reducing environmental impacts. Measurements of herbicidal activity showed that the effectiveness of paraquat was preserved after encapsulation. It was concluded that the encapsulation of paraquat in nanoparticles can provide a useful means of reducing adverse impacts on human health and the environment, and that the formulation therefore has potential for use in agriculture.},

Thus, both methods could be used for routine monitoring of the status of water bodies, according to the recommendation of the EU Water Framework Directive, while for research, K\&S is more advanced.

	abstract = {In this study, we sampled stream benthos using rapid bioassessment methods (i.e., D-nets, coarse taxonomy) from sites in and around Toronto, Ontario that represented a range of stream characteristics (e.g., drainage areas). The protocols were developed by or adapted from: (1) Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, (2) Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, (3) Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network/Ministry of the Environment, and (4) Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network/Environment Canada. Summary indices (Hilsenhoff's modified Biotic Index [HBI]; percent of fauna as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera [\% EPT]; number of taxa [S]; and Shannon's Diversity Index [H′]) calculated from the resulting data were used to evaluate differences between protocols in a series of analyses including analysis of variance and variance components analysis. The study found that sampling method was an unimportant source of variation in summary index values relative to other factors such as the stream or year sampled. The largest percent variance amongst stream or year factors (main and interactions) was at least three times greater than the corresponding method related percent variances. The results of this study suggest that these four bioassessment methods are interchangeable within the context of large geographic scales or for the detection of major impacts. In cases where impacts to the benthic community are subtle, protocols should include one or more of discrete habitat sampling, replication, and lower taxonomic resolution. The data and findings here may help agencies integrate different sampling protocols into their biomonitoring and assessment programs. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.},

Treatment of primary bean leaves with 10 mg/1 paraquat induces the formation of gel phase lipid in microsomal and chloroplast membranes and enhances the activity of superoxide dismutase, but only if the leaves are expxjsed to light. These light-depen-dent changes in membrane lipid phase properties show a close temporal correlation with enhanced O2' production by illuminated chloroplasts and the onset of lipid peroxidation. Malondialdehyde and ethane, which are both formed during lipid peroxidation, are produced in large amounts by paraquat-treated leaves exposed to light, but not by those maintained in the dark. E.lectron spin resonance measurements indicate that production of O2' by illuminated chloroplasts is more than 2-fold greater in the presence of paraquat than in its absence. The identity of the radical formed by illuminated chloroplasts in the presence of paraquat was confirmed by using the diagnostic spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-l-oxide and by establishing that its formation is sensitive to superoxide dismutase. The observations collectively indicate that paraquat-mediated membrane deterioration is light-dependent and attributable to enhanced O2'-production.

Therefore, this study investigated possible occurrence of PQ residues in some commonly consumed vegetables and the mode by which some of them were able to withstand oxidative stress condition associated with PQ toxicity. Levels of PQ residues and constituent antioxidant enzymes activities were determined spectrophotometrically. Paraquat residue concentrations in all vegetables were in the range of 0.04 to 0.27 ppm. A significant (p{\textless}0.05) increase in the activities of catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were observed in PQ-treated Amaranthus caudatus, Celocia argentea and Chorchorus olitorius as compared to the control groups during the first week of growth. Vegetables treated with 0.50 mM PQ showed initial signs of wilting without necrotic lesions. A progressive increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content of PQ-treated vegetables compared to the control was observed. The chlorophyll content of the treated vegetables decreased with increased PQ concentrations. These results did not only revealed that these vegetables showed differential sensitivity to PQ, but also suggested that elevated antioxidant enzyme activities, especially during early stage of growth, is one of the likely mechanistic basis for the observed tolerance withholding capacity of these vegetables to PQ.},

	abstract = {© 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved. Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in Brassica rapa (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (Picea engelmannii and Pinus contorta) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.},

However, none of these mechanisms correspond to the high-level resistances that have evolved naturally in weeds. Most, but not all, of the evidence from studies of paraquat-resistant biotypes of weeds can reasonably be reconciled with the proposal of a single major gene mechanism that sequesters paraquat away from chloroplasts and into the vacuole.

Resistance mechanisms have obvious fitness benefits by reducing the fitness losses attributed to infection.2. Intriguingly, animal researchers have largely ignored the role of tolerance mechanisms, through which hosts do not reduce parasite infection or growth, but alleviate the negative fitness consequences of parasite infection or growth instead. This omission stands in sharp contrast with the plant literature, where tolerance has been studied for decades and led to many important insights.3. Here, we show that the plant literature has a lot to offer for understanding defence against parasites in animals. We argue that the prevailing views on tolerance in the plant literature should direct research on animals, and that theoretical ecological and evolutionary studies should be built on tolerance measures that are feasible and relevant in empirical studies.4. Studying tolerance will enhance our understanding of how animals deal with parasites in their natural environments and may provide novel ways to combat disease.},

These relationships can have important fitness consequences, but most studies do not explicitly measure those relationships. An approach that explicitly measures relationships will further our understanding of social complexity and the consequences of both direct and indirect interactions. Social network analysis is the study of social groups as networks of nodes connected by social ties. This approach examines individuals and groups in the context of relationships between group members. Application of social network analysis to animal behaviour can advance the field by identifying and quantifying specific attributes of social relationships, many of which are not captured by more common measures of sociality, such as group size. Sophisticated methods for network construction and analysis exist in other fields, but until recently, have seen relatively little application to animal systems. We present a brief history of social network analysis, a description of basic concepts and previous applications to animal behaviour. We then highlight relevance and constraints of some network measures, including results from an original study of the effect of sampling on network parameter estimates, and we end with promising directions for research. By doing so, we provide a prospective overview of social network analysis' general utility for the study of animal social behaviour. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Here I use social network analysis to characterize and compare patterns of sociality between three populations of the leaf-roosting bat Thyroptera tricolor. Sites differed in the density of furled leaves used by T. tricolor for roosting. Finca had more leaves per hectare (77), followed by Urena (58), and Esquinas (7). The time period over which the probability of association is halved based on fitted models was 1,086days for Finca, 714days for Urena, and 303days for Esquinas. Finca and Urena had very similar network topologies, with several small clusters, high-clustering coefficients, short path lengths, low node betweenness, and high network robustness. Social networks at Esquinas were composed of one large cluster and several small isolated ones. Esquinas also had high-clustering coefficients, but path length and node betweenness were high. Network resilience was lower in Esquinas compared to Finca and Urena. These results show that, unlike many other forest-dwelling bats that switch roosts regularly, T. tricolor does not exhibit a typical fission-fusion social system, and that resource availability seems to affect social networks in this bat. In addition, this study highlights the importance of emigrating individuals in maintaining social cohesion, establishing network connectedness, and determining network robustness.},

Bats were caught from a communal roost tree with a roosting group of several hundred individuals and released with transmitters. Each roost used by the bats represented a node in the network, and the movements of bats between roosts formed the links between nodes. Despite differences in gender and reproductive stages, the bats exhibited the same behavior throughout three radiotelemetry periods and over 500 bat days of radio tracking: each roosted in separate roosts, switched roosts very infrequently, and associated with other bats only at the communal roost. This network resembled a scale-free network in which the distribution of the number of links from each roost followed a power law. Despite being spread over a large geographic area ({\textgreater} 200 km(2)), each roost was connected to others by less than three links. One roost (the hub or communal roost) defined the architecture of the network because it had the most links. That the network showed scale-free properties has profound implications for the management of the habitat trees of this roosting group. Scale-free networks provide high tolerance against stochastic events such as random roost removals but are susceptible to the selective removal of hub nodes. Network analysis is a useful tool for understanding the structural organization of habitat tree usage and allows the informed judgment of the relative importance of individual trees and hence the derivation of appropriate management decisions. Conservation planners and managers should emphasize the differential importance of habitat trees and think of them as being analogous to vital service centers in human societies.},

	abstract = {Hibernation is widely regarded as an adaptation to seasonal energy shortage, but the actual influence of energy availability on hibernation patterns is rarely considered. Here we review literature on the costs and benefits of torpor expression to examine the influence that energy may have on hibernation patterns. We first establish that the dichotomy between food- and fat-storing hibernators coincides with differences in diet rather than body size and show that small or large species pursuing either strategy have considerable potential scope in the amount of torpor needed to survive winter. Torpor expression provides substantial energy savings, which increase the chance of surviving a period of food shortage and emerging with residual energy for early spring reproduction. However, all hibernating mammals periodically arouse to normal body temperatures during hibernation. The function of these arousals has long been speculated to involve recovery from physiological costs accumulated during metabolic depression, and recent physiological studies indicate these costs may include oxidative stress, reduced immunocompetence, and perhaps neuronal tissue damage. Using an optimality approach, we suggest that trade-offs between the benefits of energy conservation and the physiological costs of metabolic depression can explain both why hibernators periodically arouse from torpor and why they should use available energy to minimize the depth and duration of their torpor bouts. On the basis of these trade-offs, we derive a series of testable predictions concerning the relationship between energy availability and torpor expression. We conclude by reviewing the empirical support for these predictions and suggesting new avenues for research on the role of energy availability in mammalian hibernation.},

This study measured the activity patterns of bats outside of their hibernaculum and asked how this winter activity varied by time, temperature, bat species, body condition, and WNS status. Over the course of three winters (2011-2013), we collected acoustic data and captured bats outside of five hibernacula in Tennessee, United States. During this time, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of white-nose syndrome, became established in hibernacula throughout the region, allowing us to track disease-related changes in the winter behavior of ten bat species. We determined that bats in the southeastern United States were active during winter regardless of disease. We recorded activity outside of hibernacula at temperatures as low as -13°C. Although bat activity was best determined by a combination of variables, the strongest factor was mean daily temperature (R(2) = .2879, F1,1450 = 586.2, p {\textless} .0001). Bats that left the hibernacula earlier in evening had lower body condition than those that left 2-4 hr after sunset (F7,932 = 7.225, p {\textless} .0001, Tukey HSD, p {\textless} .05). The number of daytime emergences from hibernacula, as determined via acoustic detection, increased the longer a site was P. destructans positive (F3,17 808 = 124.48, p {\textless} .0001, Tukey HSD, p {\textless} .05). Through the use of passive acoustic monitoring and monthly captures, we determined that winter activity was driven by both ambient temperature and the presence of P. destructans.},

	abstract = {Hibernating animals use torpor [reduced body temperature (T b) and metabolic rate] to reduce energy expenditure during winter. Periodic arousals to normal T b are energetically expensive, so hibernators trade off arousal benefits against energetic costs. This is especially important for bats with white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungal disease causing increased arousal frequency. Little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) with WNS show upregulation of endogenous pyrogens and sickness behaviour. Therefore, we hypothesized that WNS should cause a fever response characterized by elevated T b. Hibernators could also accrue some benefits of arousals with minimal T b increase, thus avoiding full arousal costs. We compared skin temperature (T sk) of captive Myotis lucifugus inoculated with the WNS-causing fungus to T sk of sham-inoculated controls. Infected bats re-warmed to higher T sk during arousals which is consistent with a fever response. Torpid T sk did not differ. During what we term "cold arousals", bats exhibited movement following T sk increases of only 2.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C, compared to {\textgreater}20 degrees C increases during normal arousals. Cold arousals occurred in both infected and control bats, suggesting they are not a pathophysiological consequence of WNS. Fever responses are energetically costly and could exacerbate energy limitation and premature fat depletion for bats with WNS. Cold arousals could represent an energy-saving mechanism for both healthy and WNS-affected bats when complete arousals are unnecessary or too costly. A few cold arousals were observed mid-hibernation, typically in response to disturbances. Cold arousals may, therefore, represent a voluntary restriction of arousal temperature instead of loss of thermoregulatory control.},

Frequency and duration of torpor bouts and arousals can affect winter sur-vival and are thought to be influenced by an optimization bal-ancing the energetic benefits of prolonged torpor against the physiological and ecological costs (e.g., accumulation of meta-bolic wastes). Female little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) spend their fat reserves more slowly than males during winter, pre-sumably so they can emerge from hibernation in good condition to initiate pregnancy. We used temperature telemetry over three winters to test a prediction of the optimization hypothesis that female M. lucifugus would use longer torpor bouts and/or shorter arousals than males. Females did conserve energy relative to males by adjusting the magnitude and duration of arousals but not the duration of torpor bouts. Although torpor bout duration did not vary by sex for adults, it did vary by age. Adults initially used longer torpor bouts than young-of-the-year, but this difference declined as cave temperature warmed in spring. Males and fe-males in better condition spent more energy during hibernation, again via increased arousal duration rather than decreased tor-por bout duration. Longer arousals by males could increase re-productive fitness if males mate with torpid females throughout winter. Our results highlight demographic differences in winter behavior for small hibernators facing extreme energy limitation in cold climates and illustrate the influence that reproductive costs have on hibernation energetics.},

	abstract = {Eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) will move into leaf litter during cold bouts of winter, and because temperatures fluctuate at these roosts, our 1st goal was to quantify winter arousals in response to ambient temperature (T-a). Additionally, we measured changes in metabolism and body temperature (T-b) during hibernation and arousals at various T-a. Using these data, we estimated winter energy budgets. Bats were captured during autumn of 2003 and 2004 in southwestern Missouri and kept in environmental chambers simulating natural conditions. We assessed torpor bout duration using temperature-sensitive data-loggers within environmental chambers at 15 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 5 degrees C, and 2 degrees C. Metabolic rate during torpor was assessed within metabolic chambers at 15 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 1 degrees C, and -5 degrees C. Examination of our data suggests that torpor bout duration was not affected by sex and it was inversely related to Ta down to 2 degrees C. Metabolic rate during torpor was not affected by sex but it did vary with Ta. Tb of hibernating bats approximated T-a and the difference between these was greatest at 1 degrees C. Our studies of thermal physiology provide insight of overwintering behaviors of L. borealis, which are apparently less constrained by thermal parameters than in other temperate bat species.},

	abstract = {Populations of hibernating bats in the northeastern USA are being decimated by white-nose syndrome (WNS). Although the ultimate cause of death is unknown, one possibility is the premature depletion of fat reserves. The immune system is suppressed during hibernation. Although an elevated body temperature (T(b)) may facilitate an immune response, it also accelerates the depletion of fat stores. We sought to determine if little brown bats Myotis lucifugus Le Conte 1831 hibernating in WNS-affected hibernacula have an elevated Tb and reduced fat stores, relative to WNS-unaffected Indiana bats Myotis sodalis Miller and Allen 1928 from Indiana. We found that WNS-affected M. lucifugus maintain a slightly, but significantly, higher skin temperature (T(skin)), relative to surrounding rock temperature, than do M. sodalis from Indiana. We also report that WNS-affected M lucifugus weigh significantly less than M lucifugus from a hibernaculum outside of the WNS region. However, the difference in T(skin) is minimal and we argue that the elevated T(b) is unlikely to explain the emaciation documented in WNS-affected bats.},

We examined variation in the hibernation patterns of free-ranging little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. First, we aimed to test the hypothesis that age, sex and body condition affect expression of torpor and energy expenditure during hibernation. Second, we examined skin temperature to assess whether qualitative differences in the thermal properties of the hibernacula of bats, compared with the burrows of hibernating rodents, might lead to different patterns of torpor and arousal for bats. We also evaluated the impact of carrying transmitters on body condition to help determine the potential impact of telemetry studies. We observed large variation in the duration of torpor bouts within and between individuals but detected no effect of age, sex or body condition on torpor expression or estimates of energy expenditure. We observed the use of shallow torpor in the midst of periodic arousals, which may represent a unique adaptation of bats for conservation of energy during the most costly phase of hibernation. There was no difference in the body condition of hibernating bats outfitted with transmitters compared with that of control bats captured from the same hibernaculum at the same time. This study provides new information on the energetics of hibernation in an under-represented taxon and baseline data important for understanding how white-nose syndrome, a new disease devastating populations of hibernating bats in North America, may alter the expression of hibernation in affected bats.},

	abstract = {Although it is well established that during periods of torpor heterothermic mammals and birds can reduce metabolic rates (MR) substantially, the mechanisms causing the reduction of MR remain a controversial subject. The comparative analysis provided here suggests that MR reduction depends on patterns of torpor used, the state of torpor, and body mass. Daily heterotherms, which are species that enter daily torpor exclusively, appear to rely mostly on the fall of body temperature (Tb) for MR reduction, perhaps with the exception of very small species and at high torpor Tb, where some metabolic inhibition may be used. In contrast, hibernators (species capable of prolonged torpor bouts) rely extensively on metabolic inhibition, in addition to Tb effects, to reduce MR to a fraction of that observed in daily heterotherms. In small hibernators, metabolic inhibition and the large fall of Tb are employed to maximize energy conservation, whereas in large hibernators, metabolic inhibition appears to be employed to facilitate MR and Tb reduction at torpor onset. Over the ambient temperature (Ta) range where torpid heterotherms are thermo-conforming, the Tb-Ta differential is more or less constant despite a decline of MR with Ta; however, in thermo-regulating torpid individuals, the Tb-Ta differential is maintained by a proportional increase of MR as during normothermia, albeit at a lower Tb. Thermal conductance in most torpid thermo-regulating individuals is similar to that in normothermic individuals despite the substantially lower MR in the former. However, conductance is low when deeply torpid animals are thermo-conforming probably because of peripheral vasoconstriction.},

Using existing data on the rate of cutaneous and pulmonary evaporative water loss (EWL) for hibernating Little Brown Bats (Myotis lucifugus) and on the duration of torpor bouts, body temperature (T-b) and oxygen uptake (V-o2) of Golden-mantled Ground Squirrels (Spermophilus saturatus), the rate of EWL, was modelled for ground squirrels hibernating at ambient temperatures (T-a) of -2, 2, 4 and 8 degrees C. 2. Total EWL showed a curvilinear response to T-a, being lowest at 2 degrees C and increasing with both increasing and decreasing T-a. EWL at -2 degrees C was about equal to that at 4 degrees C. The duration of torpor bouts showed the same curvilinear response to T-a and torpor bout duration at -2 degrees C was similar to that at 4 degrees C (8.5 vs 8.3 days, respectively). 3. At T-a greater than or equal to 2 degrees C, where T-b of torpid S. saturatus is not metabolically defended, torpor bout duration is significantly related to T-b, V-o2 and EWL, with the three variables having similar r(2) values. 4. Using the regression equations generated at T-a greater than or equal to 2 degrees C to predict torpor bout durations at -2 degrees C, where T-b is metabolically defended, shows that the three variables do not have equivalent predictive abilities. T-b and V-o2 predicted torpor bout durations of 15.2 and -40.4 days, respectively, compared with observed durations of 8.5 days at -2 degrees C. EWL predicted torpor bout durations of 8.4 days or only 0.1 days less than that observed at -2 degrees C. 5. The relation between torpor bout duration and total EWL was insensitive to major variations in cutaneous EWL. Over T-a ranging from -2 degrees C to 8 degrees C, a stepwise multiple regression including T-b, V-o2 and EWL as independent variables identified EWL as the only variable significantly correlated with torpor bout duration. 6. Our analyses suggest that torpor bout duration may be influenced by EWL, indicating that animals may need to obtain free water when they arouse. An analysis of the structural and temperature characteristics of ground squirrel hibernacula suggests that they may function as a biological condensing tower. Throughout winter, water should evaporate from the warm lower levels and condense in the colder upper regions and so free water may be available to animals when they arouse.},

	abstract = {Huddling can be defined as "an active and close aggregation of animals". It is a cooperative group behaviour, permitting individuals involved in social thermoregulation to minimize heat loss and thereby lower their energy expenditure, and possibly allowing them to reallocate the saved energy to other functions such as growth or reproduction. Huddling is especially important in the case of animals faced with high heat loss due to a high surface-to-volume ratio, poor insulation, or living in cold environments. Although numerous experimental studies have focused on the huddling behaviour of a wide range of species, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to review the various implications of this widely used behavioural strategy. Huddling allows individuals to maximise energy savings by (1) decreasing their cold-exposed body surface area, (2) reducing their heat loss through warming of ambient temperatures surrounding the group, and (3) eventually lowering their body temperature through physiological processes. Huddling provides substantial energy savings and is estimated to reduce energy expenditure by between 6 and 53\%. Broad variations in the energetic benefits of huddling depend on the number of individuals and species involved in huddles, the ambient temperatures to which individuals are exposed and the density of the aggregations. It has been shown that huddling individuals have increased survival, a lower food intake, a decreased body mass loss, increased growth rate, reduced water loss, and/or a more constant body temperature together with a significant reduction in metabolic rate. Though huddling has been studied widely, this review reveals the intricacies of this adaptive behaviour.},

	abstract = {Many animal taxa exhibit intersexual differences in sociality and resource selection that can result in variation in energy allocation budgets. Asymmetry of reproductive energetics between sexes can lead to intersexual variation in behavior to maximize lifetime reproductive success. Temperate bats show marked intersexual differences during summer when sexual segregation occurs. Although some intersexual differences have been shown in activities during the autumn mating period, they have not been examined in the context of fitness consequences for each sex. We studied autumn swarming activity of little brown and northern myotis bats (Myotis lucifugus and M. septentrionalis) in Nova Scotia, Canada, to test predictions of the hypothesis that intersexual variation in swarming behaviors occurs to maximize fitness. We conducted capture—mark—recapture surveys at swarming sites to characterize the nature and extent of intersexual variation in swarming activities. Relative to females, males occurred in disproportionally large numbers; had longer swarming seasons overlapping the female swarming season; and accounted for a disproportionately large number of recaptures at swarming sites suggesting that they had returned more frequently. No movements among swarming sites, which ranged in pairwise distance from 27.9 to 98.9 km, were detected for either species. Activity at swarming sites was highest early in the season for both species. As predicted, males engaged more frequently in swarming activities than females which likely reflect males maximizing opportunities for mating. Although their activities overlap during this period, differences suggest sex-specific activity budgets and it is likely that for each sex, individuals reconcile energetic constraints differently to maximize fitness.},

Adults of both sexes showed maximum rates of increase in body mass from mid-August to mid-September, during which time the average gain was 2.3 g for males and 2.1 g for females. These gains represent 32.9\% and 29.6\% of the pre-hibernation body masses for adult males and females, respectively. Young-of-the-year of both sexes weighed about I to 2 g less than adults during most of the pre-hibernation period, in mid-September, adult females weighed significantly less than a cohort of adult females captured at a maternity roost on the same date. Adult bats reached their maximum pre-hibernating body mass in mid-September, whereas young bars reached their maximum pre-hibernating body mass one month later. From mid-July to mid-September, we found no significant differences in mean body mass between young males and females, but in mid-October when they entered hibernation, young females weighed significantly more than young males and almost as much as adult females. Young males and females arrived at the swarming-hibernation site in late summer with an average lean body mass and fat index approximately 20\% lower than adults. By early October, young females achieved minimum adult levels of lean dry mass, but by the time they entered hibernation the lean mass of young males was still about 10\% lower than adults. During the pre-hibernation period, lean dry mass and fat mass of all bats were significantly correlated with body mass. Regression equations derived from these data were used to estimate total energy content of bats. The acquisition of maximum fat reserves by M. lucifugus In the pre-hibernation period may be as important for successful reproduction as it is for sustaining hibernation. The Fattest adult males may gain a reproductive advantage if they acquire enough energy reserves to sustain autumn mating and hibernation, and engage in multiple matings during the winter. The fattest females should gain a reproductive advantage by maximizing fat reserves before entering hibernation, and retaining sufficient energy reserves at the end of hibernation to facilitate ovulation. Relatively low survival and reduced fecundity in females at northern latitudes may reflect the relatively low fat reserves deposited by young females in their first autumn.},

	abstract = {Fungal diseases of wildlife typically manifest as superficial skin infections but can have devastating consequences for host physiology and survival. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fungal skin disease that has killed millions of hibernating bats in North America since 2007. Infection with the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans causes bats to rewarm too often during hibernation, but the cause of increased arousal rates remains unknown. On the basis of data from studies of captive and free-living bats, two mechanistic models have been proposed to explain disease processes in WNS. Key predictions of both models are that WNS-affected bats will show 1) higher metabolic rates during torpor (TMR) and 2) higher rates of evaporative water loss (EWL). We collected bats from a WNS-negative hibernaculum, inoculated one group with P. destructans, and sham-inoculated a second group as controls. After 4 mo of hibernation, TMR and EWL were measured using respirometry. Both predictions were supported, and our data suggest that infected bats were more affected by variation in ambient humidity than controls. Furthermore, disease severity, as indicated by the area of the wing with UV fluorescence, was positively correlated with EWL, but not TMR. Our results provide the first direct evidence that heightened energy expenditure during torpor and higher EWL independently contribute to WNS pathophysiology, with implications for the design of potential treatments for the disease. © the American Physiological Society.},

We tested this hypothesis using bats as a model and predicted that, during torpor, EWL and energy expenditure of huddling individuals would be lower than in individuals that are not in a huddle. We measured EWL and metabolic rate of torpid Myotis nattereri (Kuhl, 1817) huddling in groups or roosting individually. Evaporative water loss in huddling individual bats was almost 30\% lower than in solitary animals (. P=. 0.03), even after correcting for the effects of metabolic rate.

	abstract = {For temperate endotherms (i.e., mammals and birds) energy costs are highest during winter but food availability is lowest and many mammals depend on hibernation as a result. Hibernation is made up of energy-saving torpor bouts [periods of controlled reduction in body temperature (T b)], which are interrupted by brief periodic arousals to normothermic T b. What triggers these arousals in free-ranging hibernators is not well understood. Some temperate bats with intermittent access to flying insects during winter synchronize arousals with sunset, which suggests that, in some species, feeding opportunities influence arousal timing. We tested whether hibernating bats from a cold climate without access to food during winter also maintain a circadian rhythm for arousals or whether cues from conspecifics in the same cluster are more important. We used temperature telemetry to monitor skin temperature (T sk) of free-ranging little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) hibernating in central Manitoba, Canada, where temperatures from 22 October to 22 March were too cold for flying insects. We found no evidence bats synchronized arousals with photoperiod but they did arouse synchronously with other bats in the same cluster. Thus, in the northern part of their range where flying insects are almost never available during winter, little brown bats exhibit no circadian pattern to arousals. Warming synchronously with others could reduce the energetic costs of arousal for individuals or could reflect disturbance of torpid bats by cluster-mates.},

	abstract = {Hibernating bats display a wide range of thermoregulatory patterns during hibernation, but to date, the majority of research on the topic has been done on cavernicolous bats. Thus, we measured skin temperature of free-living big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) during winter in a building hibernaculum in western Indiana. Torpor bouts were considerably shorter than bouts used by cavernicolous bats, lasting a mean of 3.3 days, whereas arousals lasted on average 5.0 h. There was a significant correlation between roost temperature and length of the euthermic period and a larger proportion of bats aroused on warm days, suggesting big brown bats might be taking advantage of warm nights to forage, although evidence for winter feeding is ambiguous in this population. As has been recorded for other noncavernicolous bats during hibernation, most individuals took advantage of partial passive rewarming during some arousals. We estimate these passive arousals could save bats, on average, 96 mg of fat over the course of a 90-day hibernation period, or enough for 16.5 days of steadystate torpor, and may therefore be crucial to survival through long periods of low temperatures and low insect availability. Overall, our results suggest that hibernation patterns in big brown bats in a building hibernaculum are more similar to those of tree-hibernating bats in the Southern Hemisphere than to cavernicolous bats in North America. Further, it appears that big brown bats display extreme flexibility in hibernating patterns, which is unsurprising given their reputation as a relatively hardy species.},

	abstract = {1. Many bat species hibernate to conserve energy during winter and like all hibernators they commonly arouse. During these arousals, some bats may undertake activities away from the hibernation site. Systematic ecological studies of the frequency and purpose of winter activity in temperate zone bats of North America are rare and much of the literature involves observations of single individuals or unmarked populations. 2. We review the available literature on winter activity among North American vespertilionid bats to highlight the paucity of data on this subject and to stimulate future research. Due to the lack of repeated, systematic studies on most North American species, the conclusions drawn are general or pertain only to parts of the geographical range of any species. 3. We suggest that winter activity is ubiquitous among temperate zone bats, but the degree and purpose of activity varies greatly between and within species. In general, cave-dwelling bats tend to be relatively inactive compared with tree and foliage roosting bats during winter. 4. Cave-dwelling and tree cavity-dwelling species do not appear to feed, but they do drink and occasionally copulate during the hibernation period. Species that hibernate in foliage or leaf litter are the most active species during winter and may feed and drink throughout winter, although they probably do not copulate because of their solitary nature. 5. We encourage researchers to conduct studies on all aspects of winter activity for North American vespertilionids across wide latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. We suggest studies in the near future be focused on estimating the energetic costs and benefits of winter activity through determination of the frequency and intensity of winter feeding activity and more thorough examinations of movements within and among caves. Studies on common, wide- ranging species have the potential to illuminate large-scale patterns and differences and should be favoured over studies on rarer species.},

	abstract = {White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease of hibernating bats linked to the death of an estimated 5.7 million or more bats in the northeastern United States and Canada. White-nose syndrome is caused by the cold-loving fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), which invades the skin of the muzzles, ears, and wings of hibernating bats. Previous work has shown that WNS-affected bats arouse to euthermic or near euthermic temperatures during hibernation significantly more frequently than normal and that these too-frequent arousals are tied to severity of infection and death date. We quantified the behavior of bats during these arousal bouts to understand better the causes and consequences of these arousals. We hypothesized that WNS-affected bats would display increased levels of activity (especially grooming) during their arousal bouts from hibernation compared to WNS-unaffected bats. Behavior of both affected and unaffected hibernating bats in captivity was monitored from December 2010 to March 2011 using temperature-sensitive dataloggers attached to the backs of bats and infrared motion-sensitive cameras. The WNS-affected bats exhibited significantly higher rates of grooming, relative to unaffected bats, at the expense of time that would otherwise be spent inactive. Increased self-grooming may be related to the presence of the fungus. Elevated activity levels in affected bats likely increase energetic stress, whereas the loss of rest (inactive periods when aroused from torpor) may jeopardize the ability of a bat to reestablish homeostasis in a number of physiologic systems.},

	abstract = {Hibernating animals must time immergence and emergence carefully to maximize reproductive success and reduce the risk of encountering inclement weather or predators. Few studies of phenology exist for any hibernating species and those that do address species which mate during spring. We used passive transponders ( PIT tags) to study hibernation phenology of little brown bats M yotis lucifugus, a species that mates prior to hibernation in the fall. We expected that adult females would emerge earliest as early parturition increases juvenile survival. We predicted that females with large fat stores should emerge earliest because of their ability to tolerate inclement spring weather at the maternity roost. We also predicted that adult males would remain active later than females to maximize mating opportunities and compensate for body mass decline during the mating period. We implanted 475 bats with PIT tags and remotely recorded immergence and emergence timing at a hibernaculum in central Canada. As expected, adult males were active significantly later (median immergence date = 16 September 2011) than adult females (11 September 2011) and adult females emerged earlier (median emergence date = 6 May 2012) than both adult males (25 May 2012) and subadults (13 May 2012). Emergence timing was correlated with fall body condition in adult females, with fatter females emerging earlier, but not males. Our results highlight the importance of reproductive timing as an influence on hibernation phenology of mammals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {The fungal pathogen Geomyces destructans, which causes white-nose syndrome in bats, thrives in the cold and moist conditions found in caves where bats hibernate. To aid managers and researchers address this disease, an updated and accessible review of cave hibernacula and cave microclimates is presented. To maximize energy savings and reduce evaporative water loss during winter, most temperate vespertilionid bats in North America select caves with temperatures between 2 and 10 degrees C, with 60\%-100\% relative humidity. Generally, the temperature in caves is similar to the mean annual surface temperature (MAST) of a region, which varies by latitude, altitude, and topography. However, MAST for most areas where caves are found in eastern North America is well above 10 degrees C. Thus, various factors cause cold-air infiltration that reduces temperatures of these caves during winter. These factors include depth of cave, topographic setting, airflow patterns, cave configuration, and water infiltration. Factors affecting humidity, condensation, and evaporation are also addressed. In areas where MAST is above or below the thermal requirements of Geomyces destructans, many caves used by bats as hibernacula may still provide favorable sites for optimal growth of this fungus.},

	abstract = {Pathogens can affect host behaviour in ways that influence disease transmission as well as survival and fitness for both host and pathogen. Hibernating bats with white-nose syndrome (WNS) show a number of unusual behaviours including increased frequency of arousal from torpor, altered roosting behaviour and premature emergence. However, mechanisms underlying these patterns are not understood, and the behaviour of bats with WNS has not been examined systematically. Three hypotheses could explain increased arousal frequency. Bats may arouse to (1) groom in response to skin infection, (2) drink to offset dehydration or (3) increase activity, possibly in an attempt to access resources, avoid a source of infection or limit the risk of infecting relatives. We tested these hypotheses with captive little brown bats, Myotis lucifugus, inoculated with Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the fungus that causes WNS. In contrast to predictions of all three hypotheses, bats inoculated with the fungus tended to be less active than controls during arousals from torpor and did not increase grooming or visits to the water source in their enclosures. However, bats showed a dramatic reduction in clustering behaviour as infection progressed. Reduced activity and clustering could represent adaptive, maladaptive or pathological responses. Reduced activity could be an energy-saving mechanism or a pathological consequence of infection while reduced clustering could have beneficial or detrimental consequences for transmission, energetics, water balance and survival. Our results highlight the need for studies of host behaviour to understand dynamics of wildlife infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Hibernation (multiday torpor) and daily torpor in heterothermic mammals and birds are characterized by pronounced temporal reductions in body temperature, energy expenditure, water loss, and other physiological functions and are the most effective means for energy conservation available to endotherms. Hibernators express multiday torpor predominately throughout winter, which substantially enhances winter survival. In contrast, daily heterotherms use daily torpor lasting for several hours during the rest phase. Although torpor is still widely considered to be a specific adaptation of cold-climate species, as we will see in this primer, it is used by many diverse species from all climate zones, including the tropics. While energy conservation during adverse conditions is an important function of torpor, it is also employed to permit energy-demanding processes such as reproduction and growth, especially when food supply is limited. Even migrating birds enter torpor to conserve energy for the next stage of migration. Although many heterothermic species will be challenged by anthropogenic influences such as habitat destruction, introduced species, novel pathogens and specifically global warming, not all are likely to be affected in the same way. In fact, as argued here, it is likely that opportunistic heterotherms may be better equipped to deal with these challenges than homeotherms because heterotherms have highly flexible energy requirements, can limit foraging and reduce the risk of predation, and often are also long-lived. In contrast, strongly seasonal hibernators, especially those restricted to mountain tops, and those that have to deal with new diseases that are difficult to combat at low body temperatures, are likely to be adversely affected.},

We used sutures to attach miniature global positioning system (GPS) tags and data loggers that recorded light levels, activity, and temperature to male hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus). Results from recovered GPS tags illustrated profound differences among movement patterns by individuals, including one that completed a {\textgreater}1000 km round-trip journey during October 2014. Data loggers allowed us to record sub-hourly patterns of activity and torpor use, in one case over a period of 224 days that spanned an entire winter. In this latter bat, we documented 5 torpor bouts that lasted ≥16 days and a flightless period that lasted 40 nights.

	abstract = {Mammals usually derive energy from metabolizing fat and glycogen stores combined with exogenous food. Nectarivorous bats mostly consume a diet low in both fat and proteins but rich in simple carbohydrates. Metabolizing exogenous carbohydrates directly to fuel their high mass-specific metabolic rate would save the energetic costs of lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis for nectarivorous bats. Therefore, we expected nectarivorous bats to switch to exogenous carbohydrates rapidly when available and use them predominantly instead of fat or glycogen. We first investigated the rate of fractional incorporation of dietary sugars into the pool of metabolized substrates in Glossophaga soricina by measuring the change in 13C enrichment of exhaled CO2 (03B413Cbreath) when animals were fed glucose, fructose or sucrose that was isotopically distinct from their normal diet. Second, we performed a diet-switch experiment to estimate the turnover rate of fat tissue. When fed with sugars, the 03B413Cbreath converged quickly on the isotope signature of the ingested sugars, indicating an almost exclusive use of dietary carbohydrates. The time for a 50\% carbon isotope exchange in exhaled CO2 equalled 9, 13 and 14 min for fructose, glucose and sucrose, respectively. Nectarivorous bats fuelled 82\% of their metabolism with exogenous carbohydrate when fed with fructose, 95\% when fed with glucose and 77\% when fed with sucrose. Bats depleted 50\% of their fat stores each day. Although nectarivorous bats consumed most of their body fat each day, this was still barely enough to sustain their diurnal metabolism. The fractional incorporation rates of dietary sugars into the pool of metabolized substrates in G. soricina are the fastest rates ever found in a mammal.

Breath δ(13)C(V-PDB) was intermediate between δ(13)C(V-PDB) of insect prey and adipocyte triacylglycerols, suggesting a mixed-fuel use of P. nathusii during autumn migration. To clarify the origin of oxidized fatty acids, we performed feeding experiments with captive P. nathusii. After an insect diet, bat breath was enriched in (13)C relative to the bulk and fat portion of insects, but not deviating from the non-fat portion of insects, suggesting that bats oxidized exogenous proteins and carbohydrates, but not exogenous fatty acids. A feeding experiment with (13)C-labelled substrates confirmed these findings. In conclusion, migratory P. nathusii oxidized dietary proteins directly from insects captured en route in combination with endogenous fatty acids from adipocytes, and replenished their body reserves by routing dietary fatty acids to their body reserves.},

A rare energy-saving strategy is Dehnel's phenomenon, involving a reduction and later regrowth of the body size, several organs and parts of the skeleton in red-toothed shrews (Soricidae). The size extremes coincide with major life stages. However, the physiological consequences for the shrew's metabolism remain poorly understood. In keeping with the energetic limitations that may induce the size changes, we hypothesised that metabolic incorporation rates should remain the same across the shrews' lifetimes. In contrast, fat turnover rates should be faster in smaller subadults than in large juveniles and regrown adults, as the metabolic activity of fat tissue increases in winter individuals (subadults). Measuring the changes in the ratio of exhaled stable carbon isotopes, we found that the baseline diet of shrews changed across the season. A diet switch experiment showed that incorporation rates were consistently rapid (t50=38.2+/-21.1-69.3+/-53.5 min) and did not change between seasons. As predicted, fat turnover rates were faster in size-reduced subadults (t50=2.1+/-1.3 h) compared with larger juveniles (t50=5.5+/-1.7 h) and regrown adults (t50=5.0+/-4.4 h). In all three age/size classes, all body fat was turned over after 9-24 h. These results show that high levels of nutrient uptake are independent of body size, whereas fat turnover rates are negatively correlated with body size. Thus, the shrews might be under higher pressure to save energy in winter and this may have supported the evolution of Dehnel's phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Almost half a century ago, researchers demonstrated that the ratio of stable carbon isotopes in exhaled breath of rats and humans could reveal the oxidation of labeled substrates in vivo, opening a new chapter in the study of fuel use, the fate of ingested substrates, and aerobic metabolism. Until recently, the combined use of respirometry and stable-isotope tracer techniques had not been broadly employed to study fuel use in other animal groups. In this review, we summarize the history of this approach in human and animal research and define best practices that maximize its utility. We also summarize several case studies that use stable-isotope measurements of breath to explore the limits of aerobic metabolism and substrate turnover among several species and various physiological states. We highlight the importance of a comparative approach in revealing the profound effects that phylogeny, ecology, and behavior can have in shaping aerobic metabolism and energetics as well as the fundamental biological principles that underlie fuel use and metabolic function across taxa. New analytical equipment and refinement of methodology make the combined use of respirometry and stable-isotope tracer techniques simpler to perform, less costly, and more field ready than ever before.},

	abstract = {Spix's disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, roost in young, rolled leaves of Heliconia or Calathea plants. In this paper, we examined how the combination of high habitat availability, low occupancy rate and short longevity of those roosts may affect the pattern of interactions among individuals in the population. We regularly censused a 5.69-ha study area in northeastern Costa Rica and examined patterns of association using mark-recapture data. Thyroptera tricolor formed behaviourally cohesive social groups of mixed sex, ranging in size from four to 14 individuals. Approximately 85\% of dyads maintained associations over time periods of up to 100 days, and 40\% of dyads maintained longer-term associations of at least 420 days across sex classes. Individuals within social groups did not always roost together, but they shared a small common roosting home range, which averaged just 0.19ha. Members of different social groups rarely associated, although limited associations between members of select social groups in one subunit were observed. However, roosting home ranges of adjacent social groups often overlapped (up to 39\% of home ranges, and up to 92\% of the area of the smaller home range), and home range centres were situated less than 100m apart. Thus, social groups rarely interacted but overlapped in space. The features of this social system are unique among bats and mammals in general, and point to groupings based on kinship or cooperation. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

	abstract = {The influence of behaviour on host-parasite dynamics has theoretical support but few empirical studies have examined this influence for wild-captured hosts, especially in colonial species, which are thought to face generally high risk of exposure. Behavioural tendencies of hosts in novel en- vironments could mediate host exposure.We tested the hypothesis that behavioural tendencies of hosts, and host sex and age, correlate with prevalence and intensity of ectoparasites in a gregarious mammal, the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus).We also tested whether relationships between host behaviour and parasite prevalence and intensity would vary between taxa of ectoparasites which differ in host-seeking behaviour. We predicted that individual hosts displaying active and explo- rative behaviours would have higher prevalence and intensity of parasites that depend on physical contact among hosts for transmission (mites) but that host behaviour would not influence preva- lence and intensity of mobile ectoparasites with active host-seeking behaviour (fleas).We recorded behavioural responses of wild-captured bats in a novel-environment test and then sampled each individual for ectoparasites. After accounting for age and sex we found mixed support for our hy- potheses in some but not all demographics. More active adult and young of the year (YOY) males were more likely to host mites while more active adult and YOY females were less likely to host fleas. Our results highlight possible differences in the influence of host and parasite behaviour on parasite transmission dynamics for colonial compared to non-colonial species and have conserva- tion implications for understanding pathogen transmission in bat white-nose syndrome and other wildlife diseases.},

Reproductive, pregnant females were less immunocompetent and harboured more parasites than nonreproductive females, whilst, during lactation, immunocompetence was positively associated with female body mass. There was a dramatic increase in the T-cell response of gravid females with the advancement of gestation, which coincided with a diminution of individual parasite loads and a progressive switch of parasites from adults to juveniles. The latter not only harboured greater numbers of mites than adult female bats, but they also exhibited gravid parasites in higher proportions, indicating that juvenile hosts are more attractive for parasite reproduction than adult females.},

	abstract = {Bats of the temperate region of North America avoid winter by some combination of migration and hibernation at a location that provides the right conditions for minimizing energy expenditure over winter. Such optimal conditions are commonly found underground, and most of the best known hibernacula occur in caves or mines. Where winters are milder, some bat species hibernate in hollows in trees. Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, has the dual distinction of being relatively far north in terms of bat distribution, but with a relatively moderate oceanic climate. We hypothesized that because of the moderate winter temperatures, hibernating in trees could be an option for bats on Haida Gwaii. We used data loggers to monitor temperatures inside potential roost trees during 9 winters between 2002-2003 and 2012-2013. We found that mean winter temperature inside the trees ranged from 2.3-6.5°C, and in most years temperatures either did not drop below freezing or else did so only for short periods of time. We calculated that a 6 g bat would have required between 2.49-2.92 g of fat to hibernate in the tree roosts that we monitored, which is well within the limits that Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus) are known to accumulate in autumn. Our acoustic data demonstrated that California Myotis (Myotis californicus) were periodically active during all winter months except December, which we view as evidence that this bat hibernates locally either in trees or buildings. The absence of Little Brown Myotis, Keen's Myotis (Myotis keenii) and Silver-haired Bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) observations during winter suggests that they may either use more common hibernacula, such as caves, or migrate off the islands.

	abstract = {Many endotherms use facultative heterothermic responses of torpor or hibernation to conserve energy during periodsof low energy availability. A common assumption when estimating winter energy budgets is that endotherms shouldhibernateatthe ambient temperature(Ta)that minimizes torpid metabolic rate (TMR) and maximizes the duration of torpor bouts. However, previous studies of the energetic benefits of hibernation have assumed constant Tawithin hibernacula. Here we use an individual-based energetic model to estimate overwinter energy expenditure of mammals hibernating at Tas that vary temporally. We show that, in accordance with the principles of Jenson's inequality, hibernators can conserve energy by selecting microclimates warmer than the single Tavalue that minimizes TMR (Tmin). As temporal variation in Taincreases, endotherms should choose microclimates with mean Tas progressively warmer than Tmin. Further, as thermal conductance decreases, as it does with increasing body mass and use of social thermoregulation, the mean Tathat minimizes overwinter energy expenditure approaches, but never equals, Tmin.Wesuggest that the commonly held assumption of stable microclimatesinhibernacula has skewed the interpretation of the optimal expression of hibernation for energy conservation. Our results contradict much of the accepted understanding of hibernation energetics and add to a growing body of literature proposing that hibernating at a Tawarmer than Tminis optimal. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Thermal performance curves for all isolates displayed an intermediate peak with rapid decline in performance above the peak. Optimal temperatures for growth were between 12.5 and 15.8°C, and the upper critical temperature for growth was between 19.0 and 19.8°C. Growth rates varied across isolates, irrespective of geographic origin, and above 12°C all isolates displayed atypical morphology that may have implications for proliferation of the fungus.

	abstract = {For many animal taxa, group-living is a strategy where the cohesion provided by groups confers fitness benefits to individuals. Bats are highly gregarious with many species living in groups with complex social structures. During the summer, many temperate species are sexually segregated among roosts where females have been found to exhibit dynamic social structures and males remain understudied. We studied the group dynamics of little brown and northern Myotis bats (Myotis lucifugus and Myotis septentrionalis) during autumn swarming, a period for which social interactions are largely unknown. Using capture–mark–recapture surveys, we characterized the occurrence and frequency of age and sex groups occurring at swarms. Within a night, young-of-the-year associated more often with other bats than did adult males and females. Further, they associated more often with other young-of-the-year than adults. We found no evidence to support the maternal guidance hypothesis predicting that there would be associations between mother–offspring pairs. Adult male and female bats associated less frequently with each other and were captured alone most often. When males were captured in groups, these groups were more likely to be composed of multiple males and in M. lucifugus, males had preferred male associates they grouped with over multiple nights. Groups formed during the autumn swarming season may represent cohort groups of young bats learning of the location of sites and groups of males that are potentially cooperating to secure more mating opportunities.},

Lake Erie's infamous cyanobacterial blooms have, however, threatened the health of this valuable freshwater resource for decades. Toxic blooms dominated by the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa have most recently been one of primary ecological concerns for the lake. These toxic blooms impact the availability of potable water, as well as public health and revenues from the tourism and fishery industries. The socioeconomic effects of these blooms have spurred research efforts to pinpoint factors that drive bloom events. Despite decades of research and mitigation efforts, these blooms have expanded both in size and duration in recent years. However, through continued joint efforts between the Canadian and United States governments, scientists, and environmental managers, identification of the factors that drive bloom events is within reach. This review provides a summary of historical and contemporary research efforts in the realm of Lake Erie's harmful cyanobacterial blooms, both in terms of experimental and management achievements and insufficiencies, as well as future directions on the horizon for the lake's research community. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we show that long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. We further find that all of these factors are consistent with expected future conditions.

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the Earth’s oldest oxygenic photoautotrophs and have had major impacts on shaping its biosphere. Their long evolutionary history (∼3.5 by) has enabled them to adapt to geochemical and climatic changes, and more recently anthropogenic modifications of aquatic environments, including nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), water diversions, withdrawals, and salinization. Many cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. Bloom-forming cyanobacterial taxa can be harmful from environmental, organismal, and human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, depleting oxygen upon bloom senescence, and producing a variety of toxic secondary metabolites (e.g., cyanotoxins). How environmental factors impact cyanotoxin production is the subject of ongoing research, but nutrient (N, P and trace metals) supply rates, light, temperature, oxidative stressors, interactions with other biota (bacteria, viruses and animal grazers), and most likely, the combined effects of these factors are all involved. Accordingly, strategies aimed at controlling and mitigating harmful blooms have focused on manipulating these dynamic factors. The applicability and feasibility of various controls and management approaches is discussed for natural waters and drinking water supplies. Strategies based on physical, chemical, and biological manipulations of specific factors show promise; however, a key underlying approach that should be considered in almost all instances is nutrient (both N and P) input reductions; which have been shown to effectively reduce cyanobacterial biomass, and therefore limit health risks and frequencies of hypoxic events.},

	abstract = {We tested whether food availability, thermal environment and time of year affect torpor use and temperature selection in the large mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) in summer and winter. Food-deprived bats were torpid longer than bats offered food ad libitum. Bats placed in a gradient of low (0 °C-25 °C) ambient temperatures (Ta) spent more time in torpor than bats in a gradient of high (7 °C-43 °C) Ta's. However, we did not observe seasonal variations in the use of torpor. Moreover, even when food deprived in winter, bats never entered prolonged torpor at Ta's characteristic of their natural hibernation. Instead, bats preferred shallow torpor at relatively high Ta, but they always maintained a difference between body and ambient temperatures of less than 2 °C. Calculations based on respirometric measurements of metabolic rate showed that food deprived bats spent less energy per unit of time in torpor than fed individuals, even when they entered torpor at higher Ta's. We conclude that Ta likely serves as a signal of food availability and daily torpor is apparently an adaptation to unpredictable changes in food availability, such as its decrease in summer or its increase in winter. Thus, we interpret hibernation to be a second step in the evolution of heterothermy in bats, which allows survival in seasonal environments. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

As nocturnal animals, the flying foxes spend daytime at the roosting site, which they use for self-maintenance and reproduction. To understand the variation in diurnal behavior and time allocation for various activities in the Golden-Crowned flying fox, we investigated their daytime behavior and activity budget using instantaneous scan sampling and all occurrence focal sampling. Data collection was performed from 07:00 to 18:00 hr during January 8-17, 2017. The most frequent activity was sleeping (76.3\%). The remaining activities were wing flapping (5.0\%), self-grooming (4.2\%), hanging relaxation (3.4\%), wing spread (2.9\%), movement (2.4\%), mating/courtship (2.4\%), aggression (1.9\%), hanging alert (1.2\%), excretion (0.1\%) and scent marks (0.05\%). The frequency of sleeping, wing flapping, self-grooming, hanging relaxation, aggression, mating/courtship and movement behaviors changed with the time of the day.

	abstract = {The earliest fossil bats resemble their modern counterparts in possessing greatly elongated digits to support the wing membrane, which is an anatomical hallmark of powered flight. To quantitatively confirm these similarities, we performed a morphometric analysis of wing bones from fossil and modern bats. We found that the lengths of the third, fourth, and fifth digits (the primary supportive elements of the wing) have remained constant relative to body size over the last 50 million years. This absence of transitional forms in the fossil record led us to look elsewhere to understand bat wing evolution. Investigating embryonic development, we found that the digits in bats (Carollia perspicillata) are initially similar in size to those of mice (Mus musculus) but that, subsequently, bat digits greatly lengthen. The developmental timing of the change in wing digit length points to a change in longitudinal cartilage growth, a process that depends on the relative proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes. We found that bat forelimb digits exhibit relatively high rates of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. We show that bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) can stimulate cartilage proliferation and differentiation and increase digit length in the bat embryonic forelimb. Also, we show that Bmp2 expression and Bmp signaling are increased in bat forelimb embryonic digits relative to mouse or bat hind limb digits. Together, our results suggest that an up-regulation of the Bmp pathway is one of the major factors in the developmental elongation of bat forelimb digits, and it is potentially a key mechanism in their evolutionary elongation as well.},

The subfamily Pteropodinae includes the largest living bats and is distributed across an immense geographic range from islands in East Africa to the Cook Islands of Polynesia. These bats are keystone species in their ecosystems and some carry zoonotic diseases that are increasingly a focus of interest in biomedical research. Here we present a comprehensive phylogeny for pteropodines focused on Pteropus. The analyses included 50 of the {\textasciitilde}63 species of Pteropus and 11 species from 7 related genera. We obtained sequences of the cytochrome b and the 12S rRNA mitochondrial genes for all species and sequences of the nuclear RAG1, vWF, and BRCA1 genes for a subsample of taxa. Some of the sequences of Pteropus were obtained from skin biopsies of museum specimens including that of an extinct species, P. tokudae. The resulting trees recovered Pteropus as monophyletic, although further work is needed to determine whether P. personatus belongs in the genus. Monophyly of the majority of traditionally-recognized Pteropus species groups was rejected, but statistical support was strong for several clades on which we based a new classification of the Pteropus species into 13 species groups. Other noteworthy results emerged regarding species status of several problematic taxa, including recognition of P. capistratus and P. ennisae as distinct species, paraphyly of the P. hypomelanus complex, and conspecific status of P. pelewensis pelewensis and P. p. yapensis. Relationships among the pteropodine genera were not completely resolved with the current dataset. Divergence time analysis suggests that Pteropus originated in the Miocene and that two independent bursts of diversification occurred in the Pleistocene in different regions of the Indo-Pacific realm. © 2014 The Authors.},

Thirty-one percent of the bird community avoided the phantom road.

	abstract = {Hibernating mammals become sequestered and cease foraging during prolonged seasonal periods of reduced or unpredictable food availability and instead rely on cached food and/or endogenous reserves of fat and protein accumulated during the previous active season. The gain in weight is due to increased food consumption, but it also has been hypothesized that hibernators maximize rates of fattening by decreasing costs of maintenance before weight gain, reflected in reduced resting metabolic rate (RMR). We recorded repeated measures of total body, lean, and fat mass in individual adult male and female arctic ground squirrels across their active season and found that squirrels increased body mass by 42\% (males) and 62\% (females). This gain was achieved through a 17\% increase in lean mass and a 7-8-fold increase in fat mass; however, mass gain was not linear and patterns differed between sexes. Contrary to our hypothesis, decreases in RMR were not associated with rapid mass gain. We found RMR of males increased (wholeanimal RMR or lean-mass-specific RMR) or remained constant (mass-specific RMR) for most of the active season and decreased only after the majority of mass had been gained. In females, although RMR (whole-animal, mass-specific, and leanmass RMR) generally decreased across the active season, the greatest decrease occurred late in the active season after the majority of mass had been gained. In conclusion, arctic ground squirrels do not trade off metabolism to facilitate rates of weight gain before hibernation, but they do use energy sparing strategies before hibernation that help maintain peak mass. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

	abstract = {A significant element in the cost of a new building is devoted to fire safety. Energy efficiency drives the replacement of traditional building materials with lightweight insulation materials, which, if flammable can contribute to the fire load. Most fire deaths arise from inhalation of toxic gases. The fire toxicity of six insulation materials (glass wool, stone wool, expanded polystyrene foam, phenolic foam, polyurethane foam and polyisocyanurate foam) was investigated under a range of fire conditions. Two of the materials, stone wool and glass wool failed to ignite and gave consistently low yields of all of the toxic products. The toxicities of the effluents, showing the contribution of individual toxic components, are compared using the fractional effective dose (FED) model and LC50 (the mass required per unit volume to generate a lethal atmosphere under specified conditions). For polyisocyanurate and polyurethane foam this shows a significant contribution from hydrogen cyanide resulting in doubling of the overall toxicity, as the fire condition changes from well-ventilated to under-ventilated. These materials showed an order of increasing fire toxicity, from stone wool (least toxic), glass wool, polystyrene, phenolic, polyurethane to polyisocyanurate foam (most toxic). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Polyurethane is widely used, with its two major applications, soft furnishings and insulation, having low thermal inertia, and hence enhanced flammability. In addition to their flammability, polyurethanes form carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other toxic products on decomposition and combustion. The chemistry of polyurethane foams and their thermal decomposition are discussed in order to assess the relationship between the chemical and physical composition of the foam and the toxic products generated during their decomposition. The toxic product generation during flaming combustion of polyurethane foams is reviewed, in order to relate the yields of toxic products and the overall fire toxicity to the fire conditions. The methods of assessment of fire toxicity are outlined in order to understand how the fire toxicity of polyurethane foams may be quantified. In particular, the ventilation condition has a critical effect on the yield of the two major asphyxiants, carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.},

The gist of the theory is that much apparently random variation in human behavior is actually quite orderly and consistent, being due to certain basic differences in the way people prefer to use perception and judgment. "Perception" is here understood to include the processes of becoming aware, —of things or people or occurrences or ideas. "Judgment" is understood to include the processes of coming-to-conclusions about what has been perceived. If people differ systematically in what they perceive and the conclusions they come to, they may as a result show corresponding differences in their reactions, in their interests, values, needs and motivations, in what they do best and in what they like best to do. Adopting this working hypothesis, the Indicator aims to ascertain, from self-report of easily reported reactions, people's basic preferences in regard to perception and judgment, so that the effects of the preferences and their combinations may be established by research and put to practical use.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.023},
	abstract = {Environmental factors, such as ambient temperature (Ta) or roost/nest quality, can influence social behaviour of small-bodied endotherms because individuals may aggregate for social thermoregulation when Ta is low or select the warmest possible sites for roosting. Female temperate bats form maternity colonies in spring to communally raise pups and exploit social thermoregulation. They also select roosts with warm microclimates because low roost temperature (Troost) delays juvenile development. We studied captive female little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) to test the hypothesis that variation in Ta and Troost influence social group size. First, we predicted that female bats would preferentially select artificially heated roosts over unheated roosts. Second, we predicted that, as Ta decreased, group size would increase because bats would rely more heavily on social thermoregulation. Third, we predicted that experimentally increasing Troost (i.e., roost quality) above Ta would result in larger group sizes due to greater aggregation in high quality roosts. We captured 34 females from a maternity colony and housed them in a flight-tent provisioned with four bat boxes. Each box was outfitted with a heating pad and thermostat. Over the course of eight-days we heated each roost box in sequence to near thermoneutral Troost for two days. Bats preferentially selected heated roosts over unheated roosts but, contrary to our prediction, group size decreased when Troost was much greater than Ta (i.e., when the benefits of a warm roost should have been highest). Our results suggest that social thermoregulation and the availability of warm roosts influence aggregation in bats and have implications for the potential of summer habitat protection and enhancement to help bat populations in the face of threats like white-nose syndrome.},

	abstract = {Population structure of the threatened long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) was studied over five summers between 1993 and 1998. in temperate Nothofagus rainforest in Fiordland, New Zealand. Composition of 95 communal groups was sampled and spatial distribution of individually marked bats investigated. Individual C. tuberculatus moved to new roost sites virtually every day. Long term non-random associations among individuals were found by a cluster analysis that revealed three distinct social groups. Groups contained on average 72.0 (± 26.0) (mean ± SD), 99.3 (± 19.0) and 131.7 (± 16.5) marked individuals/year. Collective foraging ranges of the three groups overlapped but roosting occurred in three geographically distinct adjacent areas. Only 1.6\% of individuals switched between groups. Non-reproductive females and males switched between groups more often than reproductive females but individuals switched only once or twice during the study and then just for one night. Juveniles of both sexes were associated with their natal group as 1 year-olds and then later when breeding. Social groups were cryptic because foraging ranges of groups overlapped, bats belonging to each group spread over many roosts each day, and these roost sites changed from day to day. Bats moved infrequently between groups, potentially linking the local population assemblages. Future research should explore whether the population is structured in denies. Population structure did not conform to traditional metapopulation models because groups occurred in homogeneous habitat extending over a large geographical area. Conserving bat populations should entail preserving a representative number of subgroups but development of models for predicting minimum number of effective local populations is still required.},

These relationships can have important fitness consequences, but most studies do not explicitly measure those relationships. An approach that explicitly measures relationships will further our understanding of social complexity and the consequences of both direct and indirect interactions. Social network analysis is the study of social groups as networks of nodes connected by social ties. This approach examines individuals and groups in the context of relationships between group members. Application of social network analysis to animal behaviour can advance the field by identifying and quantifying specific attributes of social relationships, many of which are not captured by more common measures of sociality, such as group size. Sophisticated methods for network construction and analysis exist in other fields, but until recently, have seen relatively little application to animal systems. We present a brief history of social network analysis, a description of basic concepts and previous applications to animal behaviour. We then highlight relevance and constraints of some network measures, including results from an original study of the effect of sampling on network parameter estimates, and we end with promising directions for research. By doing so, we provide a prospective overview of social network analysis' general utility for the study of animal social behaviour. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Females associated according to the reproductive status, with lactating females preferentially roosting together. Relatedness, determined from 5 nuclear and 1 mitochondrial microsatellite, had no consistent influence on the degree of association. In combination, the indices allowed for the interpretation that nonrandom associations occur even in the absence of shared roost and group size preferences. High individual associations among reproducing female Bechstein's bats might reflect the importance of cooperation in maternity colonies.

However, the reproductive rate of bats (i.e., the proportion of females that reproduce in any breeding season) has not been critically examined. We compiled data on the reproductive rates of bats to test predictions based on life-history theory. Among 257 samples from 103 species, reproductive rate varied considerably and was typically under 100\%. Temperate-zone species had significantly lower and more variable reproductive rates than did tropical species. Reproductive rate also varied among families, with species in the Vespertilionidae having particularly high rates. As predicted based on life-history theory, reproductive rate was negatively correlated with longevity, and among vespertilionids, species with larger litters had higher reproductive rates. Thus, the data suggest that bats have relatively slow reproductive rates and, as in other life-history traits, fall at the "slow" end of the fast-slow life-history continuum found among mammals. Female bats, especially those in temperate regions, appear to adjust their allocation of resources to reproduction, and at times forego reproduction, perhaps in relation to their body condition, prey availability, and weather conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Among mammals, bats exhibit extreme variation in sociality, with some species living largely solitary lives while others form colonies of more than a million individuals. Some tropical species form groups during the day that persist throughout the year while many temperate species only gather into groups during hibernation or parturition. How groups form and then persist has now been described for a number of species, but the degree to which kinship explains patterns of association has never been quantified across species. Here, we use social network analysis and genetic data to determine the extent to which relatedness contributes to associations among individuals estimated from free-ranging animals across nine species from four families of bats. Network analysis reveals that all species show evidence of emergent social structure. Variation in the strength of the relationship between genetic relatedness and social association appears to be related to the degree of roost switching, i.e., species in which individuals change roosts frequently tend to exhibit higher levels of association among relatives. Sex-biased dispersal determines whether associations were between male or female relatives. The strength of associations among kin does not predict known occurrence of complex behaviors, such as dominance or various types of cooperation, indicating that kinship is not a prerequisite for social complexity in bats. Significance statement: The number of differentiated relationships has been proposed as a way to measure social complexity. Among primates, relationships can be differentiated on the basis of rank, age, kinship, or association. Application of this approach to other groups of mammals that vary in sociality could help reveal ecological, behavioral, or cognitive similarities and differences between species. As a first step toward this approach, we used social network analysis on long-term individual records and estimated relatedness using genetic markers for nine species of bats. We confirmed nonrandom emergent social structure in all species. Kinship was predictive of social association among individuals of the same sex in a few species, but largely independent of the occurrence of complex behaviors, such as dominance among males or cooperation among females. Complex social behavior in bats appears to require frequent interactions among a small number of individuals that roost together for multiple years.},

Ten vocalizations were identified and associated with certain behavioral contexts. 2. Echolocation pulses, although primarily used for or entation, are also available as interindividual communication signals and modified forms are used in several situations such as during near-collisions in flight and the first flights of newly volant young. 3. Nonecholocation calls are used in three main contexts. Agonistic vocalizations appear to take the place of physical aggression and may be used to protect an individual's position within a roost. Two vocalizations emitted in maternal-infant situations appear to contain vocal signatures which are important for individual recognition. During mating, a distinct copulation call given by males likely conveys a male's sexual motivation to a female in the absence of precopulatory displays. 4. The size of the vocal repertoire is comparable to those of some solitary mammals. Behavioral observations indicate that despite the gregarious nature of the species, a simple social system exists and the small repertoire is therefore not surprising. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.},

The highest tents above the ground were observed in Philodendron popenoei and Rhodospatha wendlandii, whereas tents in Philodendron grandipes and A. alata were significantly lower than any other species. Asplundia alata and R. wendlandii also had the highest frequency of leaves modified per plant. Fidelity of bats to tents was low, although bats used several tents intermittently within a restricted area. Males generally were more faithful to tents than females, although not significantly so. This observation, along with indirect evidence of leaf modification, suggests that males are primarily responsible for tent construction. The two study sites differed in the plants used for roosting and in tent fidelity. Bats in Corcovado used a greater variety of plant species for tent roosting, whereas bats in Golfito were more faithful, suggesting that roosting resources were scarcer at the latter site. © 2005 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {We used radiotelemetry to quantify roost switching and assess associations between members of maternity colonies of forest-dwelling big brown bats. Bats remained loyal to small roosting areas of forest within and between years and switched trees often (X±SD=1.7±0.7days). For radiotagged bats from the colony in one of these areas, roost-switching frequency was positively correlated with the number of different individuals with which tagged bats shared roosts. We quantified associations between pairs of bats using a pairwise sharing index and found that bats associated more often than predicted when roost and roostmate selection were random but that all tagged bats spent at least some days roosting in different trees, apart from preferred roostmates. Our results suggest that forest-dwelling big brown bats conform to a fission-fusion roosting pattern. Roost switching in forests may reflect the maintenance of long-term social relationships between individuals from a colony that is spread among a number of different trees on a given night. In this fission-fusion scenario, switching between trees, within a local area, could serve to increase the numbers of individuals with which bats maintain associations. We contend that roosting areas in forests are analogous to spatially large roosts in caves, mines and buildings. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Fission–fusion dynamics appear common among temperate bats where females form roost groups that change in size and composition, as females switch roosts almost daily. One hypothesis for frequent roost switching is that females move to find suitable thermal conditions as ambient conditions change. Tests of this hypothesis have, however, been conducted mostly at roosts in artificial structures where microclimate is relatively stable. The goal of our study was to determine whether roost switching and roost use by northern long-eared bats, Myotis septentrionalis, that roost in trees are related to ambient conditions. We used generalized linear fixed effects models to explore the influence of roost characteristics and changes in ambient conditions on the likelihood of roost switching. We used canonical correlation analyses to examine the relationship between ambient conditions and roost characteristics. Roost switching was indeed linked to ambient conditions together with characteristics of roosts on the previous day; the best descriptors of roost switching differed between the two geographical regions we analysed. In Nova Scotia, females were less likely to switch roosts when it rained, particularly if they were in roosts below surrounding canopy whereas they were more likely to switch roosts when they were in roosts of high decay. Females roosted in shorter trees in earlier decay classes on warm days, as well as on windy and rainy days. In Kentucky, females were more likely to switch roosts at high temperatures, particularly when they were in roosts in high decay. Females roosted in shorter, decayed trees on warm days, and in less decayed trees with small diameter on windy and rainy days. Our results suggest bats switch roosts in response to changes in ambient conditions to select suitable roosting conditions, which may explain some of the proximate factors shaping fission–fusion dynamics of bats.},

At the start of the study the bars roosted under loose bark or in cavities in dead trees. Seven of eight trees were still standing in 2000, although all had lost bark since 1995, particularly ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa). In 1995, after radio-tagged bats had moved and the tags had fallen off, trees either M ere occupied by colonies of 5 to 52 M. californicus or they were unoccupied. In contrast, roost counts in subsequent)ears indicated that colonies rarely used the same trees and most observations were of one or two bats. Thus, while bats continued to use most of the trees ol er the 5 y period, the numbers of individuals declined and much of the use may have been by males or non-reproductive females. Although our study is preliminary, the results suggest that the suitability of roosts of tree-dwelling bats declines relatively rapidly compared to the loss of the snags themselves.

Most species live in groups for at least a portion of their life cycle and behavioural evidence suggests that individuals of many species live within complex nonrandomly assorting societies. However, rigorous quantitative characterizations of bat societies have been rare because of the difficulties inherent in studying these highly mobile, small, nocturnal animals. Here we use an automated monitoring system (PIT tags), telemetry, and recently developed analytical techniques to investigate the social organization (size, sexual composition, and spatiotemporal cohesion) and social structure (pattern of social interactions and relationships among individuals) of a colony of free-living northern long-eared bats, Myotis septentrionalis (Trouessart, 1897). Cluster analysis of HWI (half-weight association index) for all pairs and permutation tests indicate that colonies consist of multiple, nonrandomly assorting subgroups. A plot of the temporal persistence of relationships (standardized lagged association rate) showed that roosting groups dissociate over periods of approximately 10 days after which subsets of individuals remain associated throughout the summer roosting season. A model representing a two-levelled social structure of long-term (whole summer) and short-term (up to 10 days) acquaintances best fit the lagged association rate.

Temperate vespertilionid bats are thought to exhibit the typical mammalian pattern of male-biased dispersal although relatively few studies have been conducted on this group. The northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) is a relatively common forest dwelling bat found in eastern North America. Despite being a common species in North America, relatively little is known about its habitat requirements and life history characteristics including dispersal patterns. Using five polymorphic microsatellite loci I found that females within localized subpopulations exhibited a higher degree of genetic structuring than males indicating female philopatry and male-biased dispersal [female FST 5 0.011; male FST 5 20.016; P 5 0.006 (sex-biased dispersal randomization test)]. I also found a weak (FST 5 0.002), but significant (P 5 0.03), average fixation index for the subpopulations examined which is consistent with other studies on temperate vespertilionid bats. The presence of maternity site fidelity in M. septentrionalis may have important conservation implications since commercial and private development that thins or removes potential roost trees could have an impact on pregnant female bats that will have to incur additional costs of searching for new roosting habitat as they return from their hibernacula.},

	abstract = {Many species show fission-fusion group dynamics because it has clear advantages for flexibly exploiting heterogeneous environments. However, the mechanisms by which these dynamics arise are not well known. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model to disentangle the different influences on spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) individual fissions and fusions, including the three dimensions of fission-fusion dynamics (subgroup size, dispersion, and composition). Furthermore, we considered the influences of other individuals also leaving or joining a subgroup at the same time. We found that the most important influence on individual fissions and fusions is whether other individuals are also doing the same. Subgroup size and dispersion did not have clear effects on the probability that an individual fissioned or fusioned, while individuals tended to leave subgroups that were biased toward the opposite sex and to join subgroups that were biased toward their own sex. The networks constructed by the inter-individual influences during fissions and fusions were cohesive and did not show assortativity by sex or by degree. Individuals had a similar degree in both networks and each was influenced by a different set of individuals, suggesting a high fluidity in the social networks. We suggest that these networks reflect the way in which information about the environment flows as individuals follow one another during fissions and fusions. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity can be broadly defined as the ability of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype when exposed to different environments, as the modification of developmental events by the environment, or as the ability of an individual organism to alter its phenotype in response to changes in environmental conditions. Not surprisingly, the study of phenotypic plasticity is innately interdisciplinary and encompasses aspects of behavior, development, ecology,evolution, genetics, genomics, and multiple physiological systems at various levels of biological organization. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, phenotypic plasticity may be a powerful means of adaptation and dramatic examples of phenotypic plasticity include predator avoidance, insect wing polymorphisms, the timing of metamorphosis in amphibians, osmoregulation in fishes, and alternative reproductive tactics in male vertebrates. From a human health perspective, documented examples of plasticity most commonly include the results of exercise, training, and/or dieting on human morphology and physiology. Regardless of the discipline, phenotypic plasticity has increasingly become the target of a plethora of investigations with the methodological approaches utilized ranging from the molecular to whole organsimal. In this article, we provide a brief historical outlook on phenotypic plasticity; examine its potential adaptive significance; emphasize recent molecular approaches that provide novel insight into underlying mechanisms, and highlight examples in fishes and insects. Finally, we highlight examples of phenotypic plasticity from a human health perspective and underscore the use of mouse models as a powerful tool in understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypic plasticity. © 2012 American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {Nest or roost temperature (T roost) is thought to impact reproductive fitness in many endotherms but few studies have directly tested the hypothesis that naturally occurring variability in nest or roost microclimate is large enough to affect reproductive success. We conducted a field experiment to test whether roost selection by cavity-dwelling, reproductive female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) is more strongly influenced by roost microclimate or a physical characteristic of roosts that facilitates social thermoregulation (i.e., cavity volume). We quantified spatial variability in T roost within different-sized, unoccupied cavities and also recorded T roost in occupied vs unoccupied roost trees. We used equations relating energy use and ambient temperature for big brown bats to calculate values of daily energy expenditure from T roost data because energy is a currency that likely affects reproductive fitness. We found no difference between maximum and minimum T roost, spatial variability in T roost, or predicted energy expenditure in more-preferred vs less-preferred roosts. However, there was a significant difference between T roost and predicted energy expenditure when we compared occupied vs unoccupied roosts. The presence of bats increased T roost by as much as 7°C, and there was a significant positive correlation between the number of bats occupying a roost, maximum daily T roost, and energy savings. We calculate that, on average, a normothermic individual would save about 6.5 kJ/day (roughly 9\% of the daily energy budget) by roosting in an occupied cavity relative to roosting alone and that savings may increase to 40 kJ/day (about 53\% of the energy budget) for an individual roosting in a group of 45 bats. Our findings suggest that variability in microclimate among potential roost or nest sites may be less important to some cavity-dwelling endotherms than has been suggested in previous studies. Our results reinforce the importance of sociality and social thermoregulation to the roosting ecology of forest-living bats and socially roosting or nesting endotherms in general. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Temperament describes the idea that individual behavioural differences are repeatable over time and across situations. This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, exploration- avoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology. © 2007 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

We found evidence strongly suggestive of fission-fusion behavior, or changes in group size and composition of sand tigers, related to five behavioral modes (summering, south migration, community bottleneck, dispersal, north migration). Our study shows sexually dimorphic behavior during migration, in addition to presenting evidence of a potential solitary phase for these typically gregarious sharks. Sand tigers spent up to 95 consecutive and 335 cumulative hours together, with the strongest relationships occurring between males. Species that exhibit fission-fusion group dynamics pose a particularly challenging issue for conservation and management because changes in group size and composition affect population estimates and amplify anthropogenic impacts.},

While behavioural ecologists examine the evolution of interactions between parents and offspring in the light of parent-offspring conflict and its resolution, quantitative geneticists explore the evolution of such interactions in the light of parent-offspring co-adaptation due to combined effects of parental and offspring behaviours on fitness. To date, there is little interaction or integration between these two fields. Here, we first review the merits and limitations of each of these two approaches and show that they provide important complementary insights into the evolution of strategies for offspring begging and parental resource provisioning. We then outline how central ideas from behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics can be combined within a framework based on the concept of behavioural reaction norms, which provides a common basis for behavioural ecologists and quantitative geneticists to study the evolution of parent-offspring interactions. Finally, we discuss how the behavioural reaction norm approach can be used to advance our understanding of parent-offspring conflict by combining information about the genetic basis of traits from quantitative genetics with key insights regarding the adaptive function and dynamic nature of parental and offspring behaviours from behavioural ecology. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

Thus, the HWI may not be a good measure of relationships between individuals: it could indicate strong affinities that do not exist and vice versa. Here we present a new index, the HWIG, that corrects the association index between two individuals for their respective levels of gregariousness. We compared the HWIG to the HWI by simulating populations in which individuals varied in their gregariousness and their affinities for each other. Unlike the HWIG, the estimation of associations made by the HWI was strongly influenced by the gregariousness of individuals: the HWI was systematically less strongly correlated with the true (input) affinity than the HWIG and this discrepancy increased when variation in individual gregariousness increased. We recommend using the HWIG, or similar variants of other common association indices, as unbiased measures of association between individuals. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Information on the dynamics of social links and interactions among individuals is of high importance to the understanding of the evolution of animal sociality, including that of humans. However, detailed longterm data on such dynamics in wild mammals with fully known demography and kin structures are scarce. Applying a weighted network analysis on 20 500 individual roosting observations over 5 years, we show that in two wild Bechstein's bat colonies with high fission-fusion dynamics, individuals of different age, size, reproductive status and relatedness maintain long-term social relationships. In the larger colony, we detected two stable subunits, each comprising bats from several family lineages. Links between these subunits were mainly maintained by older bats and persisted over all years. Moreover, we show that the full details of the social structure become apparent only when large datasets are used. The stable multi-level social structures in Bechstein's bat colonies resemble that of elephants, dolphins and some primates.

	abstract = {Abstract: Previous research has shown that competition, familiarity, diet, and relatedness can all influence aggregation patterns in garter snakes. We controlled for these factors and examined social aggregation patterns in juvenile Eastern garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis). We assayed snakes individually for consistent individual differences in boldness and sociability. We then placed snakes in groups of 10 in an enclosure with four shelters and observed their social interactions over a period of 8 days. We demonstrate that the snakes actively seek social interaction, prefer to remain with larger aggregates, and associate nonrandomly with specific individuals or groups. We show that their social interaction patterns are influenced by individual boldness, sociability, and age. The snakes’ social networks were perturbed twice a day by “shuffling” their locations. Despite these disturbances, the snakes eventually re-formed their preferred social environment. Aggregation and exploration patterns also varied across time, with most activity occurring later in the day. These results highlight the complexity of snake sociality and may have important implications for conservation efforts. Significance statement: Snakes are often considered nonsocial animals, but this is inaccurate. We used social network analyses to compare juvenile Eastern garter snakes’ group behaviors to their individual personalities. Our research demonstrates that these snakes actively seek out social interaction and prefer to join and remain with larger groups and that their social interaction patterns are influenced by consistent individual differences in boldness and sociability. Our work contributes to a sparse but growing body of literature on sociability in reptiles. This work is important for changing perceptions among the scientific community and the public as a whole. As a consequence, it may aid efforts in developing appropriate conservation techniques that consider sociability patterns in relocated reptiles.},

To quantify metrics of gene flow and infer movement dynamics, we genotyped 679 M. lucifugus at nine nuclear microsatellites (nDNA) and sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We found high levels of genetic diversity and little population structure, with ≈13-fold higher differentiation of mtDNA than nDNA markers, suggesting that structuring patterns largely result from female philopatry. Discriminant analysis of principle components suggested that the subtle underlying structure was not concordant with sampling site. Regional differentiation (FST, Dest, Mantel test residuals) is mostly consistent with genetic isolation by distance. However, samples from Newfoundland showed genetic differentiation over and above the effects of distance, lower levels of genetic diversity, and less genetic connectivity with other sampled regions. Despite this, oceanic straits in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence do not appear to create an impenetrable barrier to movement, therefore it may be possible for white-nose syndrome to spread to Newfoundland.},

	abstract = {Ethologists use a variety of terminology such as “personality”, “temperament” and “behavioral syndromes” almost interchangeably to discuss the phenomenon of individuals within a population of animals consistently varying from one another in their behavioral responses to stimuli. This interchangeable usage of terminology has contributed to confusion within the field of animal behavior and limits the study of the phenomenon. Here we use a rapid, non-exhaustive and repeatable search strategy literature review to investigate where there were unique distinctions between these three terms and where there was an overlap in their usage. We identified three main areas of confusion in terminology: historical usage which is not updated; a lack of precision between different fields of study; and a lack of precision between different levels of variation. We propose a framework with which to understand and define the terms based on the levels of variation ethologists are interested in. Consistent individual animal behavioral variation relates to the different structures of variation of between-individual/between-population and between and across contexts. By formalizing this framework we provide clarity between the three terms which can be easily defined and understood.},

In social species, for example many bats, energy expenditure is influenced by environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature, and also by social thermoregulation. Direct measurements of daily fluctuations in metabolic rates in response to ambient and behavioural variables in the field have not been technologically feasible until recently. During different reproductive periods, we investigated the relationships between ambient temperature, group size and energy expenditure in wild maternity colonies of Bechstein's bats (Myotis bechsteinii). Bats used behavioural and physiological adjustments to regulate energy expenditure. Whether bats maintained normothermia or used torpor, the number of bats in the roosts as well changed with reproductive status and ambient temperature. During pregnancy and lactation, bats remained mostly normothermic and daily group sizes were relatively large, presumably to participate in the energetic benefits of social thermoregulation. In contrast, smaller groups were formed on days when bats used torpor, which occurred mostly during the post-lactation period. Thus, we were able to demonstrate on wild animals under natural conditions the significance of behavioural and physiological flexibility for optimal thermoregulatory behaviour in small endotherms. © The Author(s) 2010.},

	abstract = {Nest or roost temperature (T roost) is thought to impact reproductive fitness in many endotherms but few studies have directly tested the hypothesis that naturally occurring variability in nest or roost microclimate is large enough to affect reproductive success. We conducted a field experiment to test whether roost selection by cavity-dwelling, reproductive female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) is more strongly influenced by roost microclimate or a physical characteristic of roosts that facilitates social thermoregulation (i.e., cavity volume). We quantified spatial variability in T roost within different-sized, unoccupied cavities and also recorded T roost in occupied vs unoccupied roost trees. We used equations relating energy use and ambient temperature for big brown bats to calculate values of daily energy expenditure from T roost data because energy is a currency that likely affects reproductive fitness. We found no difference between maximum and minimum T roost, spatial variability in T roost, or predicted energy expenditure in more-preferred vs less-preferred roosts. However, there was a significant difference between T roost and predicted energy expenditure when we compared occupied vs unoccupied roosts. The presence of bats increased T roost by as much as 7°C, and there was a significant positive correlation between the number of bats occupying a roost, maximum daily T roost, and energy savings. We calculate that, on average, a normothermic individual would save about 6.5 kJ/day (roughly 9\% of the daily energy budget) by roosting in an occupied cavity relative to roosting alone and that savings may increase to 40 kJ/day (about 53\% of the energy budget) for an individual roosting in a group of 45 bats. Our findings suggest that variability in microclimate among potential roost or nest sites may be less important to some cavity-dwelling endotherms than has been suggested in previous studies. Our results reinforce the importance of sociality and social thermoregulation to the roosting ecology of forest-living bats and socially roosting or nesting endotherms in general. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {The decision where to live has far-reaching fitness consequences for animals. In contrast to most other mammals or birds that use sheltered nest sites, female Bechstein's bats frequently switch day roosts during one breeding season, and therefore must often decide where to spend the day. Selecting the right roost is important, because roost quality, e.g. microclimatic condition, influences survival and reproduction in bats. Although thermal factors are very important for the quality of roosts occupied by bats, whether bats base their day roost selection directly on roost temperature has not been tested in the field. Over one summer, we examined and tested the roost choice of 21 individually marked female Myotis bechsteinii living in one maternity colony. In a field experiment, we allowed the bats to choose between relatively warm versus cold bat boxes, while controlling for site preferences. We expected females to exhibit a preference for warm roosts during pregnancy and lactation to accelerate gestation and shorten the period of growth of their young. Roost occupancy over 160 census days reflected significant temperature differences among 89 surveyed roosts (14 tree holes and 75 bat boxes), and preferences changed with the season. Females significantly preferred cold roosts before parturition, whereas post-partum, they significantly favoured warm roosts. Temperature preferences were independent of the roost site, and thus roost selection was based directly on temperature. Boxes with significantly different daytime temperatures did not differ significantly at night. Consequently, bats would have to spend at least 1 day in a new roost to test it. Information transfer among colony members might facilitate knowledge of roost availability. Access to many roosts providing different microclimates is likely to be important for successful reproduction in the endangered Bechstein's bat.},

Using a data logger, I simultaneously measured the temperature in cavities selected by bats as roosts and the temperature in available but unselected cavities. The maternity roosts chosen by noctule bats, Nyctalus noctula (Schreber, 1774), and Leisler's bats, N. leisleri (Kuhl, 1817), during late pregnancy and lactation were warmer than unoccupied cavities, but temperature ranges in the two types of cavity did not differ. A logistic regression model showed that the mean cavity temperature during the night (2200-0400) and the minimum cavity temperature over a 24 h period were crucial for roost selection. This suggests that female noctule and Leisler's bats selected roosts that promoted juvenile growth and used tree cavities that could save them energy while they were active because the cavity temperatures were close to the lower critical temperature of their thermoneutral zone. I also suggest that selection of warmer cavities minimized the bats' energy expenditure prior to emergence from the roost and that passive rewarming inside the cavity was an important factor in minimizing energetic costs of roosting by bats in BPF. Mean and maximum temperatures recorded near tree trunks increased with the height at which the temperature was measured (ground level, 10, 20, and 30 m), suggesting that bats can gain thermal benefits from insolation of the trunk by selecting highly placed cavities, as was observed in BPF. © 2006 NRC.},

We studied within- and between-season movements of individual little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) throughout a 337,540-km2 study area in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario, Canada. Our objectives were to quantify proportions of male and female bats that relocated from hibernacula and/or summer roosts between years, proportions of males and females captured at swarms that hibernated at those sites versus other hibernacula, and distances traveled by males and females during relocation events. We predicted that bats would exhibit male-biased dispersal, with males significantly more likely to relocate and more likely to travel long distances during relocation events. Between 1989 and 2010, we recaptured 1,459 of 10,432 banded individuals. Seasonal movements from hibernacula and/or swarms to summer colonies ranged widely from 10 to 647 km. Consistent with previous studies we found high fidelity to summer colonies and hibernacula across years. However, some individuals switched sites between years and the median relocation distance was 315 km, with over 20\% of individual movements exceeding 500 km. Surprisingly, we found that females were significantly more likely to relocate than males. Our data could help explain apparent jumps in the distribution of G. destructans, but more data on transmission of the fungus in the wild are needed.},

The number of studies investigating sociality in bats is rapidly increasing, with studies ranging from basic descriptions of the number of males and females within social groups to studies using social network analysis. Studies of sociality in bats are taking increasingly diverse approaches to data collection, analysis and interpretation, leaving researchers with an array of perspectives on how to conduct future research. These perspectives are difficult to synthesize, but an integrated understanding of pioneering works in this field should help researchers build upon what is already known about sociality in bats and formulate new hypotheses. Herein we provide a review of methodologies used to measure social interactions, relationships, and structure in bats. We review assumptions, sources of bias, strengths, and limitations of these methods. We emphasize that while all of the reviewed methods are well suited for assessing social interactions and relationships, each method will impact analyses of social structure and should be considered carefully. We encourage further use of social network analysis as a framework for conceptualizing, designing, and analyzing studies of bat sociality. We do not advocate any single network analysis methodology, as network analysis is continually evolving and no one technique is well suited for all research questions. Instead, we recommend several specific network measures we believe are appropriate for different types of research questions and datasets and discuss the strengths and limitations of popular analyses.},

Sheep exhibited consistent individual differences in social centrality. Controlling for maternal carryover effects and age, the positive effect of centrality in a social network on adult female lamb production and survival was equal or greater than the effect of body mass or population density. Social centrality had less effect on male survival and no effect on adult male lamb production or lamb survival.

Critics argue that the field is riddled with terminological and methodological inconsistencies and lacks a sound theoretical framework. Nevertheless, experimental biologists are increasingly studying individual differences in physiology and relating these to differences in behaviour, which can lead to fascinating insights. We encourage this trend, and in this Commentarywe highlight some of the benefits of estimating variation in (and covariation among) phenotypic traits at the inter- and intra-individual levels. We focus on behaviour while drawing parallels with physiological and performance-related traits. First, we outline some of the confusion surrounding the terminology used to describe repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour. Second, we argue that acknowledging individual behavioural differences can help researchers avoid sampling and experimental bias, increase explanatory power and, ultimately, understand how selection acts on physiological traits. Third, we summarize the latest methods to collect, analyse and present data on individual trait variation. We note that, whilemeasuring the repeatability of phenotypic traits is informative in its own right, it is only the first step towards understanding how natural selection and genetic architecture shape intra-specific variation in complex, labile traits. Thus, understanding how and why behavioural traits evolve requires linking repeatable inter-individual behavioural differences with core aspects of physiology (e.g. neurophysiology, endocrinology, energy metabolism) and evolutionary biology (e.g. selection gradients, heritability).},

Such individual differences in degree of specialization can persist over time-scales of months or even years in long-lived animals, but the mechanisms leading to these different individual strategies are not fully understood. There is accumulating evidence that individual variation in foraging behaviour is shaped by animal personality traits, such as boldness. Despite this, the potential for boldness to drive differences in the degree of specialization is unknown. In this study, we used novel object tests to measure boldness in black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) breeding at four colonies in Svalbard and deployed GPS loggers to examine their at-sea foraging behaviour. We estimated the repeatability of foraging trips and used a hidden Markov model to identify locations of foraging sites in order to quantify individual foraging site fidelity. Across the breeding season, bolder birds were more repeatable than shy individuals in the distance and range of their foraging trips, and during the incubation period (but not chick rearing), bolder individuals were more site-faithful. Birds exhibited these differences while showing high spatial similarity in foraging areas, indicating that site selection was not driven by personality-dependent spatial partitioning. We instead suggest that a relationship between boldness and site fidelity may be driven by differences in behavioural flexibility between bold and shy individuals. Together, these results provide a potential mechanism by which widely reported individual differences in foraging specialization may emerge.},

This stable hierarchy suggests a role for individual differences mediating leadership decisions within homing pigeon pairs. What these differences are, however, has remained elusive. Using novel quantitative techniques to analyse habitual route structure, we show here that leadership can be predicted from prior route-following fidelity. Birds that are more faithful to their own route when homing alone are more likely to emerge as leaders when homing socially. We discuss how this fidelity may relate to the leadership phenomenon, and propose that leadership may emerge from the interplay between individual route confidence and the dynamics of paired flight.

Foraging areas were identified using area-restricted search, defined as periods during which birds decrease speed and increase turning. Our results demonstrate that birds were considerably more specialised in the habitat in which they forage than the exact location they use within years, and there was a similar pattern between years. However, despite this, it was site fidelity that explained reproductive success. Within a single year, females which were more faithful to a specific location had higher reproductive success than non-specialists, and between years there was a tendency for both sexes. Our results suggest that black-browed albatrosses are highly faithful in their foraging habitat but it is rather site fidelity that is more clearly associated with reproductive success.},

	abstract = {Navigational control of avian migration is understood, largely from the study of terrestrial birds, to depend on either genetically or culturally inherited information. By tracking the individual migrations of Atlantic Puffins, Fratercula arctica, in successive years using geolocators, we describe migratory behaviour in a pelagic seabird that is apparently incompatible with this view. Puffins do not migrate to a single overwintering area, but follow a dispersive pattern of movements changing through the non-breeding period, showing great variability in travel distances and directions. Despite this within-population variability, individuals show remarkable consistency in their own migratory routes among years. This combination of complex population dispersion and individual route fidelity cannot easily be accounted for in terms of genetic inheritance of compass instructions, or cultural inheritance of traditional routes. We suggest that a mechanism of individual exploration and acquired navigational memory may provide the dominant control over Puffin migration, and potentially some other pelagic seabirds, despite the apparently featureless nature of the ocean. © 2011 Guilford et al.},

	abstract = {1. Estimating variation in demographic rates, such as survival and fecundity, is important for testing life-history theory and identifying conservation and management goals. 2. We used 16 years (1993-2008) of mark-recapture data to estimate age-specific survival and breeding probabilities of the little brown myotis Myotis lucifugus LeConte in southern New Hampshire, USA. Using Kendall \& Nichols' (1995) full-likelihood approach of the robust design to account for temporary emigration, we tested whether survival and breeding propensity is influenced by regional weather patterns and timing of reproduction. 3. Our results demonstrate that adult female survival of M. lucifugus ranged from 0·63 (95\% CL = 0·56, 0·68) to 0·90 (95\% CL = 0·77, 0·94), and was highest in wet years with high cumulative summer precipitation. First-year survival [range: 0·23 (95\% CL = 0·14, 0·35) to 0·46 (95\% CL = 0·34, 0·57)] was considerably lower than adult survival and depended on pup date of birth, such that young born earlier in the summer (c. late May) had a significantly higher probability of surviving their first year than young born later in the summer (c. mid-July). Similarly, the probability of young females returning to the maternity colony to breed in the summer following their birth year was higher for individuals born earlier in the summer [range: 0·23 (95\% CL = 0·08, 0·50) to 0·53 (95\% CL = 0·30, 0·75)]. 4. The positive influence of early parturition on 1st-year survival and breeding propensity demonstrates significant fitness benefits to reproductive timing in this temperate insectivorous bat. 5. Climatic factors can have important consequences for population dynamics of temperate bats, which may be negatively affected by summer drying patterns associated with global climate change. 6.

Agricultural fields may provide an abundance of insect prey, but are also risky habitats due to their exposure. How bats use mixed landscapes is important information for biologists, as increasing development affects the amount of suitable habitat and impacts bat populations in the region. Using acoustic recording, we monitored relative bat activity in open areas and edges of the woodland/farmland interface of agricultural fields in Kent County, DE. We examined bat activity among different sites, in openings versus edges, among crop types, relative to nearby forest fragment size and shape, and under different weather conditions. Bat activity was significantly higher along edges than in the open in the agricultural fields for passes/night, but we found no differences among crop types or sites and no interaction effects. We also found no effect of size or amount of edge of a fragment on bat activity. We found significant negative correlations between passes and temperature and wind speed, and significant positive correlations between passes and relative humidity and barometric pressure. Bats use agricultural areas for foraging, and the woodland interfaces along these fields are important for bat activity. This study provides data that may help engender conservation practices, such as retention of forested edges and maintenance of tree lines, and perhaps crop selection and pest control management, in the region's farming community.},

This 'individual specialisation' is a widespread phenomenon in natural populations, but until recently few studies quantified the magnitude of individual specialisation and how this magnitude varies among populations or contexts. Such quantitative approaches are necessary for us to understand how ecological interactions influence the amount of among-individual variation, and how the amount of variation might affect ecological dynamics. Herein, we review recent studies of individual specialisation, emphasising the novel insights arising from quantitative measures of diet variation. Experimental and comparative studies have confirmed long-standing theoretical expectations that the magnitude of among-individual diet variation depends on the level of intra and interspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. In contrast, there is little empirical information as to how individual specialisation affects community dynamics.

Central theories explaining the maintenance of such behavioural variation posits that individuals expressing greater “risky” behaviours should suffer higher mortality. Here, for the first time, we synthesize the existing empirical evidence for this key prediction. Our results did not support this prediction as there was no directional relationship between riskier behaviour and greater mortality; however there was a significant absolute relationship between behaviour and survival. In total, behaviour explained a significant, but small, portion (5.8\%) of the variance in survival. We also found that risky (vs. “shy”) behavioural types live significantly longer in the wild, but not in the laboratory. This suggests that individuals expressing risky behaviours might be of overall higher quality but the lack of predation pressure and resource restrictions mask this effect in laboratory environments. Our work demonstrates that individual differences in behaviour explain important differences in survival but not in the direction predicted by theory. Importantly, this suggests that models predicting behaviour to be a mediator of reproduction-survival trade-offs may need revision and/or empiricists may need to reconsider their proxies of risky behaviours when testing such theory.},

As a step towards the conservation of caves and cave-dwelling bats in South Africa, this study aimed to (i) broadly identify the number of caves used by bats (any species) and specifically M. natalensis, throughout South Africa, (ii) investigate the number of maternity and hibernacula roosts currently known for M. natalensis, (iii) assess the number of caves located in formal protected areas, (iv) determine potential migration paths/corridors between hibernacula and maternity sites and (v) evaluate the potential threats (like onshore wind facilities) along potential migratory routes. A meta-analysis of scientific literature and websites was conducted to identify caves throughout South Africa and locations of maternity and hibernacula roosts for M. natalensis. Roosts were assessed to determine whether (i) they were located in protected areas, (ii) they were used for eco-tourism and (iii) the distance to primary roads and onshore wind energy facilities. Next, likely migratory paths were modelled between maternity and hibernacula sites using least-cost path analysis and the threats along potential routes were investigated. A total of 92 caves were identified, 50 were reported to contain bats. M. natalensis were recorded in 37 caves, and of those, only 9\% are currently located inside protected areas. A total of 12 least-cost paths were modelled, and various paths intersected potential threat risk elements. Our analysis provides the first description of the potential migration corridors for M. natalensis in South Africa, as well as the current conservation status of bat-inhabited caves. For a developing country set to experience increased urbanisation pressures, this study highlights the need for conservation measures for South African caves and the dependent bats.},

	abstract = {Individuals often differ in what they do. This has been recognised since antiquity. Nevertheless, the ecological and evolutionary significance of such variation is attracting widespread interest, which is burgeoning to an extent that is fragmenting the literature. As a first attempt at synthesis, we focus on individual differences in behaviour within populations that exceed the day-to-day variation in individual behaviour (i.e. behavioural specialisation). Indeed, the factors promoting ecologically relevant behavioural specialisation within natural populations are likely to have far- reaching ecological and evolutionary consequences. We discuss such individual differences from three distinct perspectives: individual niche specialisations, the division of labour within insect societies and animal personality variation. In the process, while recognising that each area has its own unique motivations, we identify a number of opportunities for productive ‘crossfertilisation’ among the (largely independent) bodies of work. We conclude that a complete understanding of evolutionarily and ecologically relevant individual differences must specify how ecological interactions impact the basic biological process (e.g. Darwinian selection, development and information processing) that underpin the organismal features determining behavioural specialisations. Moreover, there is likely to be covariation amongst behavioural specialisations. Thus, we sketch the key elements of a general framework for studying the evolutionary ecology of individual differences. Keywords},

This simplification is only justified if interindividual niche variation is rare, weak, or has a trivial effect on ecological processes. This article reviews the incidence, degree, causes, and implications of individual-level niche variation to challenge these simplifications. Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantified the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population's niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reflecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population's stability, the amount of intraspecific competition, fitness-function shapes, and the population's capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly. Our collection of case studies suggests that individual specialization is a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon that poses many important but unanswered questions.},

This is predicted to favour bolder and more aggressive individuals together with greater flexibility in behaviour. Previous work has focussed primarily on studying these traits in captive birds and has shown increased aggression and reduced consistency between traits (behavioural syndromes) in birds from urban populations. However, personality (consistency within a behavioural trait) has not been well studied in the wild. Here we tested whether urban free-living male great tits show greater territorial aggression than rural counterparts. We also tested predictions that both behavioural syndromes and personality would show lower consistency in urban populations. We found that urban populations were more aggressive than rural populations and urban birds appeared to show lower levels of individual behavioural repeatability (personality) as predicted. However, we found no effect of urbanisation on behavioural syndromes (correlations between multiple behavioural traits). Our results indicate that urban environments may favour individuals which exhibit increased territorial aggression and greater within-trait flexibility which may be essential to success in holding urban territories. Determining how urban environments impact key fitness traits will be important in predicting how animals cope with ongoing urbanisation.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question of current ecological research concerns the drives and limits of species responses to human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC). Behavioural responses to HIREC are a key component because behaviour links individual responses to population and community changes. Ongoing fast urbanization provides an ideal setting to test the functional role of behaviour for responses to HIREC. Consistent behavioural differences between conspecifics (animal personality) may be important determinants or constraints of animals’ adaptation to urban habitats. We tested whether urban and rural populations of small mammals differ in mean trait expression, flexibility and repeatability of behaviours associated to risk-taking and exploratory tendencies. Using a standardized behavioural test in the field, we quantified spatial exploration and boldness of striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius, n = 96) from nine sub-populations, presenting different levels of urbanisation and anthropogenic disturbance. The level of urbanisation positively correlated with boldness, spatial exploration and behavioural flexibility, with urban dwellers being bolder, more explorative and more flexible in some traits than rural conspecifics. Thus, individuals seem to distribute in a non-random way in response to human disturbance based on their behavioural characteristics. Animal personality might therefore play a key role in successful coping with the challenges of HIREC.},

	abstract = {A fundamental focus of current ecological and evolutionary research is to illuminate the drivers of animals’ success in coping with human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC). Behavioural adaptations are likely to play a major role in coping with HIREC because behaviour largely determines how individuals interact with their surroundings. A substantial body of research reports behavioural modifications in urban dwellers compared to rural conspecifics. However, it is often unknown whether the observed phenotypic divergence is due to phenotypic plasticity or the product of genetic adaptations. Here, we aimed at investigating (a) whether behavioural differences arise also between rural and urban populations of non-commensal rodents; and (b) whether these differences result from behavioural flexibility or from intrinsic behavioural characteristics, such as genetic or maternal effects. We captured and kept under common environment conditions 42 rural and 52 urban adult common voles (Microtus arvalis) from seven subpopulations along a rural–urban gradient. We investigated individual variation in behavioural responses associated with risk-taking and exploration, in situ at the time of capture in the field and ex situ after 3 months in captivity. Urban dwellers were bolder and more explorative than rural conspecifics at the time of capture in their respective sites (in situ). However, when tested under common environmental conditions ex situ, rural individuals showed little change in their behavioural responses whereas urban individuals altered their behaviour considerably and were consistently shyer and less explorative than when tested in situ. The combination of elevated risk-taking and exploration with high behavioural flexibility might allow urban populations to successfully cope with the challenges of HIREC. Investigating whether the observed differences in behavioural flexibility are adaptive and how they are shaped by additive and interactive effects of genetic make-up and past environmental conditions will help illuminate eco-evolutionary dynamics under HIREC and predict persistence of populations under urban conditions.},

Such intraspecific differences in behaviour have been widely assumed to be non-adaptive variation surrounding (possibly) adaptive population-average behaviour. Nevertheless, in keeping with recent calls to apply Darwinian reasoning to ever-finer scales of biological variation, we sketch the fundamentals of an adaptive theory of consistent individual differences in behaviour. Our thesis is based on the notion that such 'personality differences' can be selected for if fitness payoffs are dependent on both the frequencies with which competing strategies are played and an individual's behavioural history. To this end, we review existing models that illustrate this and propose a game theoretic approach to analyzing personality differences that is both dynamic and state-dependent. Our motivation is to provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of an apparently common animal trait: personality, which has far reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.},

In this paper we introduce the R-package cAIC4 that allows for the computation of the conditional Akaike Information Criterion (cAIC). Computation of the conditional AIC needs to take into account the uncertainty of the random effects variance and is therefore not straightforward. We introduce a fast and stable implementation for the calculation of the cAIC for linear mixed models estimated with lme4 and additive mixed models estimated with gamm4. Furthermore, cAIC4 offers a stepwise function that allows for a fully automated stepwise selection scheme for mixed models based on the conditional AIC.

	abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of 'variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances. © 2012 The Authors. Methods in Ecology and Evolution © 2012 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Nest or roost temperature (T (roost)) is thought to impact reproductive fitness in many endotherms but few studies have directly tested the hypothesis that naturally occurring variability in nest or roost microclimate is large enough to affect reproductive success. We conducted a field experiment to test whether roost selection by cavity-dwelling, reproductive female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) is more strongly influenced by roost microclimate or a physical characteristic of roosts that facilitates social thermoregulation (i.e., cavity volume). We quantified spatial variability in T (roost) within different-sized, unoccupied cavities and also recorded T (roost) in occupied vs unoccupied roost trees. We used equations relating energy use and ambient temperature for big brown bats to calculate values of daily energy expenditure from T (roost) data because energy is a currency that likely affects reproductive fitness. We found no difference between maximum and minimum T (roost), spatial variability in T (roost), or predicted energy expenditure in more-preferred vs less-preferred roosts. However, there was a significant difference between T (roost) and predicted energy expenditure when we compared occupied vs unoccupied roosts. The presence of bats increased T (roost) by as much as 7 degrees C, and there was a significant positive correlation between the number of bats occupying a roost, maximum daily T (roost), and energy savings. We calculate that, on average, a normothermic individual would save about 6.5 kJ/day (roughly 9\% of the daily energy budget) by roosting in an occupied cavity relative to roosting alone and that savings may increase to 40 kJ/day (about 53\% of the energy budget) for an individual roosting in a group of 45 bats. Our findings suggest that variability in microclimate among potential roost or nest sites may be less important to some cavity-dwelling endotherms than has been suggested in previous studies. Our results reinforce the importance of sociality and social thermoregulation to the roosting ecology of forest-living bats and socially roosting or nesting endotherms in general.},

Although preferential associations have been documented in multiple species, this phenomenon has never been empirically studied in bats—the second largest order of mammals, where many of the 1200+ species live in groups of tens to hundreds of individuals. Given the current understanding of the social behaviour exhibited in this species, we explored the possibility that adult female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus (Beauvois, 1796)) show preferential association between group-mates using a pairwise choice design with individuals from a captive colony. Focal individuals were placed in a Y-maze and were given free choice of two familiar conspecifics. We measured the time focal individuals spent in close proximity to each conspecific. Our results indicate that some bats exhibit preferential association between group-mates, as multiple individuals spent significantly more time in close proximity to one conspecific versus another, despite randomizing the position of stimulus bats between trials. Given the frequent and long-term associations between group members of this species, social preferences could play a significant role in the outcomes of their long-term fitness.},

	abstract = {Host behavior can affect host-pathogen dynamics, and sociality is predicted to increase risk of pathogen exposure. Many species minimize costs of parasitism by only aggregating seasonally, such as during reproductive periods, but colonial species may still be limited in their potential to evade pathogens. Bats are among the most gregarious mammals and females of many temperate species form maternity colonies in summer where they communally raise pups in both natural and anthropogenic roost structures. Social network structure may differ between natural and anthropogenic roosts in ways that affect pathogen dynamics. We used social network analysis to quantify interactions of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in a tree-roosting colony, where the colony is divided among multiple trees each day, and a building colony, where most of the colony roosts together each day. We simulated transmission of a pathogen throughout both sets of networks. We tested three hypotheses: (1) network metrics differ between pregnancy and lactation; (2) changing network structure between reproductive stages influences predicted pathogen dynamics; and (3) network metrics and predicted pathogen dynamics differ between colonies of bats in trees versus buildings. Network structure was weaker for bats roosting in trees during pregnancy and lactation compared to bats roosting in a building, and our models showed that a hypothetical pathogen would spread more rapidly for bats in the building colony. Our results are important for understanding variation in social tendencies and pathogen transmission among colonies of bats and have implications for conservation and public health. Significance statement Host behavior, particularly social behavior, can affect dynamics of wildlife pathogens. Bats are highly social mammals and females of temperate species form colonies in spring and early summer in tree or building roosts. Thermal characteristics of trees and buildings appear to differ in ways that affect roosting behavior and social interactions. We used social network analyses to quantify interactions of big brown bats in tree and building roosts and simulated consequences for pathogen dynamics. Network structure was weaker for bats roosting in trees with more frequent roost switching and relatively diffuse contacts across the network. Our models showed that a hypothetical pathogen could spread up to four times faster in a building colony compared to a colony of bats roosting in trees. Our …},

Animal social networks are descriptions of social structure which, aside from their intrinsic interest for understanding sociality, can have significant bearing across many fields of biology. 2. Network analysis provides a flexible toolbox for testing a broad range of hypotheses, and for describing the social system of species or populations in a quantitative and comparable manner. However, it requires careful consideration of underlying assumptions, in particular differentiating real from observed networks and controlling for inherent biases that are common in social data. 3. We provide a practical guide for using this framework to analyse animal social systems and test hypotheses. First, we discuss key considerations when defining nodes and edges, and when designing methods for collecting data. We discuss different approaches for inferring social networks from these data and displaying them. We then provide an overview of methods for quantifying properties of nodes and networks, as well as for testing hypotheses concerning network structure and network processes. Finally, we provide information about assessing the power and accuracy of an observed network. 4. Alongside this manuscript, we provide appendices containing background information on common programming routines and worked examples of how to perform network analysis using the r programming language. 5. We conclude by discussing some of the major current challenges in social network analysis and interesting future directions. In particular, we highlight the under-exploited potential of experimental manipulations on social networks to address research questions.},

In this study we built a dynamic model of social networks to represent a succession of temporary fissions involving a change in social relations that could potentially lead to irreversible group fission (i.e. no more group fusion). This is the first study that assesses how a social network changes according to group fission-fusion dynamics. We built a model that was based on different parameters: the group size, the influence of nutritional needs compared to social needs, and the changes in the social network after a temporary fission. The results obtained from this theoretical data indicate how the percentage of social relation transfer, the number of individuals and the relative importance of nutritional requirements and social links influence the average number of days before irreversible fission occurs. The greater the nutritional needs and the higher the transfer of social relations during temporary fission, the fewer days will be observed before an irreversible fission.

	abstract = {Animal social networks can be extremely complex and are characterized by highly non-random interactions between group members. However, very little is known about the underlying factors affecting interaction preferences, and hence network structure. One possibility is that behavioural differences between individuals, such as how bold or shy they are, can affect the frequency and distribution of their interactions within a network. We tested this using individually marked three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and found that bold individuals had fewer overall interactions than shy fish, but tended to distribute their interactions more evenly across all group members. Shy fish, on the other hand, tended to associate preferentially with a small number of other group members, leading to a highly skewed distribution of interactions. This was mediated by the reduced tendency of shy fish to move to a new location within the tank when they were interacting with another individual; bold fish showed no such tendency and were equally likely to move irrespective of whether they were interacting or not. The results show that animal social network structure can be affected by the behavioural composition of group members and have important implications for understanding the spread of information and disease in social groups. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

An important component of an individual's environment is its social environment. However, few studies look beyond dyadic relationships and try to place the personality of individuals in the context of a social network. Social network analysis provides us with many new metrics to characterize the social fine-structure of populations and, therefore, with an opportunity to gain an understanding of the role that different personalities play in groups, communities and populations regarding information or disease transmission or in terms of cooperation and policing of social conflicts. The network position of an individual is largely a consequence of its interactive strategies. However, the network position can also shape an individual's experiences (especially in the case of juveniles) and therefore can influence the way in which it interacts with others in future. Finally, over evolutionary time, the social fine-structure of animal populations (as quantified by social network analysis) can have important consequences for the evolution of personalities-an approach that goes beyond the conventional game-theoretic analyses that assumed random mixing of individuals in populations. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

We studied species- and gender-specific aspects of summer range extent and stand selection in northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) and little brown bats (M. lucifugus)in the Greater Fundy Ecosystem, New Brunswick, Canada, using trapping, radiotelemetry, and ultrasonic monitoring. Our results suggested that this 2-species system is comprised of 4 ecologically distinct groups with respect to site selection and range extent for roosting and foraging. All bats exhibited an affinity to specific roosting areas. Myotis septentrionalis roosted and foraged in the forest interior. The roosting and foraging areas for females were 6.1 times and 3.4 times larger, respectively, than for males. Both genders foraged in site types in proportion to their availability. Myotis lucifugus females roosted in buildings outside the core study area, and those captured in the forested landscape were transients. Compared to male and female M. septentrionalis, male M. lucifugus had intermediate-sized roosting areas but the largest foraging areas. Water sites were selected during foraging more than expected. Bat foraging activity, measured acoustically at 8 site types, was greatest at lakes and least above the forest canopy. Male M. lucifugus activity levels were positively associated with temperature and the amount of mature coniferous forest and water within 1 kmof the sampling site, and they were negatively associated with the amount of mature deciduous forest within 1 kmof the site. Our results suggested that understanding gender effects is crucial for accurate characterization of forest bat habitats. Studies of bats that combine data for genders, species, or guilds may produce spurious results and may be of minimal value for, or actually hinder, bat conservation and management programs.},

However, many models developed for managing wildlife resources assume that all individuals are equal. Killer whales are social animals that rely on relationships within and among family groups for survival. In the northeastern Pacific, fish-eating, 'resident' killer whale populations are composed of matrilines from which offspring do not disperse. We analysed the influence of various individuals' age, sex and matrilineal affiliation on their position in a social network. Here, we show that some matrilines appeared to play more central roles than others in the network. Furthermore, juvenile whales, especially females, appeared to play a central role in maintaining network cohesion. These two key findings were supported subsequently by simulating removal of different individuals. The network was robust to random removals; however, simulations that mimicked historic live-captures from the northeastern Pacific were likely to break the network graph into isolated groups. This finding raises concern regarding targeted takes, such as live-capture or drive fisheries, of matrilineal cetaceans. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

However, little is known of the link between personality, social behaviour and population structure. We combine a well-understood personality trait with large-scale social networks in wild songbirds, and show that personality underpins multiple aspects of social organisation. First, we demonstrate a relationship between network centrality and personality with 'proactive' (fast-exploring) individuals associating weakly with greater numbers of conspecifics and moving between flocks. Second, temporal stability of associations relates to personality: 'reactive' (slow-exploring) birds form synergistically stable relationships. Finally, we show that personality influences social structure, with males non-randomly distributed across groups. These results provide strong evidence that songbirds follow alternative social strategies related to personality. This has implications not only for the causes of social network structure but also for the strength and direction of selection on personality in natural populations. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

Recently, there have been calls for studies of animal social networks to take account of temporal dynamics in social relationships as these have implications for the spread of information and disease, group cohesion, and the drivers of sociality, and there is evidence that maintaining stable social relationships has fitness benefits. It has recently been recognized that male elephants form strong social bonds with other males. The nature of these relationships, and thus network structure, may vary over time in response to varying environmental conditions and as individuals age. Using social network analysis, we examine the stability of relationships and network centrality in a population of male African elephants. Our results suggest that males may maintain stable social relationships with others over time. Older males show greater stability in network centrality than younger males, suggesting younger males face uncertainty in transitioning to adult society. For elephants, where older individuals function as social repositories of knowledge, maintaining a social network underpinned by older males could be of particular importance.},

	abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability.

	abstract = {Abstract: Sociality describes the tendency for members of a species to associate in a group based on social attraction. To balance the trade-offs of sociality, the fitness consequences (and therefore proclivity towards being social) should be expected to vary across individuals and within the same individual, across time. We used social network analysis to evaluate the causes and consequences of within- and between-individual variation in sociality in a wild population of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) during the reproductive season. We hypothesised that individuals would adjust their behaviours based on a key life-history event: reproduction. We assessed this variation by comparing differences in social behaviour between individuals in different life history stages and within individuals across the reproductive season. We predicted breeding females would increase their agonistic interactions to protect their offspring from infanticide during reproduction, while non-reproductive individuals would increase their affiliative interactions to maintain stability in their social network and increase their indirect fitness. We found that the number of social interactions decreased after reproduction for all individuals. Breeding females did not increase their agonistic interactions compared to other groups, but instead had overall decreased social interactions during reproduction, which corresponded with increased fitness. For non-breeding females, an increase of affiliative social interactions correlated with increased indirect fitness as we predicted. Our multiple-level, temporally structured analyses revealed under-realised complexities regarding within- and between-individual variation in social interactions, suggesting reproductive status dictates different social strategies to optimise fitness. Significance statement: Social living with conspecifics confers a range of costs and benefits, the trade-offs of which are expected to change based on life history. Therefore, individuals should modulate their sociality across life history transitions to optimise fitness. Reproductive status is known to affect socio-behavioural decisions across taxa. We used a highly social species, black-tailed prairie dogs, to investigate variation in social structure across the reproductive season, and understand both the causes and consequences of individual variation in social structure. Prairie dogs offered easily observable, dynamic social behaviours and quantifiable fitness consequences to truly demonstrate acute social change. Our results suggest that there is variation of social interactions not only within individuals over time, but also between reproductive groups in the same time period. Our analyses suggest that social variation has important consequences for fitness and should further stimulate study of temporally based analyses of social behaviour.},

	abstract = {Grouping is a very common outcome of selection that operates on individual animals. Largely considered to be driven by immediate benefits, such as avoiding predators, animal groups often consist of individuals that are phenotypically more similar than expected from the population distribution. This suggests that the distribution and fitness of phenotypes may be shaped by multiple levels of selection operating along different axes of behaviour. Thus, quantifying assortative mixing, or the measure of association between similar individuals in social networks, should be a key component of the biologist's toolbox. Yet, assortment is rarely tested in animal social networks. This may be driven by a lack of tools for robust estimation of assortment, given the reliance of current methods on binary networks. In this paper, I extend existing approaches that calculate the assortativity coefficient of both nominal classes and continuous traits to incorporate weighted associations. I have made these available through a new R package 'assortnet'. I use simulated networks to show that weighted assortment coefficients are more robust than those calculated on binary networks to added noise that could arise from random interactions or sampling errors. Finally, I demonstrate how these methods differ by applying them to two existing social networks estimated from wild populations, exploring assortment by species, sex and network degree. Given the parallel theoretical developments of the importance of local social structure on population processes, and increasing data on social networks being collected in free-living populations, understanding phenotypic assortment could yield significant insight into social evolution. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Recent studies have investigated how the phenotypic composition of groups or aggregations (e.g., its average phenotype or phenotypic variance) affects ecological and social processes, and how multi-level selection can drive phenotypic covariance among interacting individuals. However, we argue that these questions are rarely studied together. We present a unified framework to address this gap, and discuss how group phenotypic composition (GPC) can impact on processes ranging from individual fitness to population demography. By emphasising the breadth of topics affected, we hope to motivate more integrated empirical studies of the ecological and evolutionary implications of GPC. Members of animal groups often vary in their phenotypes (e.g., personality, morphology). Many recent studies have shown how different aspects (e.g., phenotypic average, variation, extreme) of GPC affect group-level outcomes (e.g., foraging success, mating system). Group-level outcomes can shape selection when individual and group phenotypes co-vary. Selection arising from GPC can drive changes in traits that affect aspects of individual-to-group covariance, such as behaviours that determine group membership or by changing the expression of traits (via phenotypic plasticity or indirect genetic effects). A framework based on interacting phenotype theory can quantify the selective consequences and evaluate the evolutionary implications of GPC. This framework is still largely unexplored empirically but it is applicable to many topics in evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that animal personality can affect many aspects of an individual's behaviour, life history and fitness. However, there have been few studies about the link between personality and social organization in the context of wild mammals in their own natural environments. This article reports on ecologically relevant data, linking experimental data from the wild to long-term social association data in a socially and cognitively complex mammal species (bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus). Here, I used behavioural data to describe personality differences between bottlenose dolphins and social network analysis to assess the relationship between personality and social structure. First, I measured the reaction of photo-identified individuals over time and across contexts as a trade-off between a novelty-seeking behaviour (boldness) and a novelty-averse behaviour (shyness). Second, I applied social network analysis to understand the link between the observed shy–bold continuum and social organization, while controlling for other factors that could contribute to affiliation. This study presents for the first time consistent individual differences in behavioural response to novelty, as a proxy for the shy–bold continuum, in wild bottlenose dolphins. Bold individuals had a central role in the social network with stronger associations than shy individuals, suggesting that bold individuals may play an important role in group cohesion, group stability and the spread of information through the network. Together, these findings provide insights into how a social network is structured by personality in wild bottlenose dolphins, with potential fitness consequences. Furthermore, this study provides additional evidence of the existence of social personalities in nonhuman animals and contributes to the understanding of the role of personality in determining the extent to which mammals associate with others.},

	abstract = {Allee effects have important implications for many aspects of basic and applied ecology. The benefits of aggregation of conspecific individuals are central to Allee effects, which have led to the widely held assumption that social species are more prone to Allee effects. Robust evidence for this assumption, however, remains rare. Furthermore, previous research on Allee effects has failed to adequately address the consequences of the different levels of organisation within social species’ populations. Here, we review available evidence of Allee effects and model the role of demographic and behavioural factors that may combine to dampen or strengthen Allee effects in social species. We use examples across various species with contrasting social structure, including carnivores, bats, primates and eusocial insects. Building on this, we provide a conceptual framework that allows for the integration of different Allee effects in social species. Social species are characterised by nested levels of organisation. The benefits of cooperation, measured by mean individual fitness, can be observed at both the population and group levels, giving rise to “population level” and “group level” Allee effects respectively. We also speculate on the possibility of a third level, reporting per capita benefits for different individuals within a group (e.g. castes in social insects). We show that group size heterogeneity and intergroup interactions affect the strength of population-level demographic Allee effects. Populations with higher group size heterogeneity and in which individual social groups cooperate demonstrate the weakest Allee effects and may thus provide an explanation for why extinctions due to Allee effects are rare in social species. More adequately accounting for Allee effects in social species will improve our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary implications of cooperation in social species.},

In this paper, we focus on the recently proposed hypothesis that social niche specialization (i.e. individuals in a population occupy different social roles) can explain the maintenance of individual differences in personality. We first present ecological and social niche specialization hypotheses. In particular, we show how niche specialization can be quantified and highlight the link between personality differences and social niche specialization. We then review some ecological factors (e.g. competition and environmental heterogeneity) and the social mechanisms (e.g. frequency-dependent, state-dependent and social awareness) that may be associated with the evolution of social niche specialization and personality differences. Finally, we present a conceptual model and methods to quantify the contribution of ecological factors and social mechanisms to the dynamics between personality and social roles. In doing so, we suggest a series of research objectives to help empirical advances in this research area.

Clustering is seen in many species of animals and probably has an anti‐predator or information‐transfer function. Regardless of its function, clustering in the emergence of bats may intensify as a result of large numbers of individuals trying to pass through a small exit hole in a short period of time. A total of 31 observations of emergence were made from May to Aug. 1992 and 1993 at a maternity colony of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), in Cypress Hills, Saskatchewan, Canada. To determine the effects of a predator on clustering in the emergence, a plastic great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) was used as a predator model and mounted close to roost exits on 8 nights. Recorded calls of a great horned owl were played back towards the roost. The predator model and associated calls did not affect the number of bats that emerged, the median time of emergence, or the degree of clustering in the emergence. There was a significant positive relationship between the extent of clustering in the emergence and the number of bats that emerged. Emergences of more than 25 bats were clustered. Thus, we found no evidence to support clustering during emergence as being an anti‐predator response. However, clustering may be intensified with increased numbers of individuals trying to pass through a narrow space in a short period of time. 1994 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

	abstract = {Abstract: Animal individuals show patterns of behavior that are stable within individuals but different among individuals. Such individual differences are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in specific suites of so-called behavioral syndromes that are consistent across different contexts and with time. Here, we present a field investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context. We further investigated how individual differences affect choice performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the two-month observation period. We investigated the link between individual behavioral measures and measures of choice performance using generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of choice performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This may indicate that foraging behavior depends on multiple individual behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models of behavioral syndromes. Significance statement: Nectar-feeding bats, like other animals including humans, have their own peculiar ways of consuming food that differ among individuals of the same species. We characterized the feeding habits of individuals in a population of wild, free-flying bats that were trained to gather nectar from computer-automated artificial flowers in a Costa Rican rainforest. Individual bats responded to the experimental conditions in different ways, but consistently over the two-month observation period. For example, some bats frequently returned to the same flowers, while others tended to meticulously probe most flowers they encountered before returning to a previously visited location. Interestingly, bats also consistently differed in how fast they learned to avoid flowers with dilute nectar and the faster learners were the bats that made only a few visits on each feeding trip. This suggests that individual foraging strategies might be associated with differences in foraging efficiency.},

Using a captive population, repeatability was assessed for aggression, exploration, and activity. Moderate repeatabilities were observed for all behaviours, indicating that individuals exhibit consistent behaviour over time. There were no significant correlations among behaviours.

Termed niche construction, this process has been studied primarily at the ecological level with an emphasis on the consequences of construction across generations1. We focus on the behavioural process of construction within a single generation, identifying the role a robustness mechanism2-conflict management-has in promoting interactions that build social resource networks or social niches. Using 'knockout' experiments on a large, captive group of pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), we show that a policing function, performed infrequently by a small subset of individuals 3, significantly contributes to maintaining stable resource networks in the face of chronic perturbations that arise through conflict. When policing is absent, social niches destabilize, with group members building smaller, less diverse, and less integrated grooming, play, proximity and contact-sitting networks. Instability is quantified in terms of reduced mean degree, increased clustering, reduced reach, and increased assortativity. Policing not only controls conflict3-5, we find it significantly influences the structure of networks that constitute essential social resources in gregarious primate societies. The structure of such networks plays a critical role in infant survivorship6, emergence and spread of cooperative behaviour7, social learning and cultural traditions8. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {The use of social network analysis to quantify animal social relationships has increased exponentially over the last two decades. A popular aspect of social network analysis is the use of individually based network metrics. Despite the diversity of social network metrics that exist and the large number of studies that generate network metrics, little guidance exists on the number and type of metrics that should be analysed in a single study. Here, we comment on the ‘hypothesize after results are known’ (HARKing) phenomenon in the context of social network analysis, a practice that we term ‘metric hacking’ and define as the use of statistical criteria to select which metrics to use rather than a priori choice based on a research hypothesis. We identify three situations where metric hacking can occur in studies quantifying social network metrics: (1) covariance among network metrics as explanatory variables in the same model; (2) covariance among network metrics as response variables in multiple models; and (3) covariance between response and explanatory variables in the same model. We outline several quantitative and qualitative issues associated with metric hacking, provide alternative options and guidance on the appropriate use of multiple network metrics to avoid metric hacking. By increasing awareness of the use of multiple social network metrics, we hope to encourage better practice for the selection and use of social network metrics in animal social network analysis.},

The hallmark of map-based navigation is the ability to perform shortcuts, i.e., to move in direct but novel routes. When tracking an animal in the wild, it is extremely difficult to determine whether a movement is truly novel because the animal's past movement is unknown. We overcame this difficulty by continuously tracking wild fruit bat pups from their very first flight outdoors and over the first months of their lives. Bats performed truly original shortcuts, supporting the hypothesis that they can perform large-scale map-based navigation. We documented how young pups developed their visual-based map, exemplifying the importance of exploration and demonstrating interindividual differences.},

	abstract = {Studies on the response of wildlife to human disturbance generally focus on demographic changes or on physiological and behavioural modifications directly related to stress response. Yet fewer studies have explored whether the distribution of individual animals in response to human disturbance is influenced by temperament. Temperament represents the consistency of responses of individuals in reaction to novel or challenging situations. Individuals are thus assumed to express highly consistent behaviour-hormonal response under specific stress conditions. In this study, we investigate the relations between exploration, grooming-scanning continuum, emotionality, and docility of individual Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) and location of their burrow respective to frequentation by humans. We then assess the relationship between cortisol accumulated in the hair and both temperament and frequentation by humans. Explorative or docile chipmunks were more common in frequented areas. Hair cortisol increased with docility, but was not related to human frequentation. These results indicate that temperament may cause animals to distribute themselves in a non-random way in response to human disturbance. Integrating temperament into studies of the stress response of wildlife to humans could therefore help us understand the impact of tourism on wildlife. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This capture record indicates that the female bat was at least 23 y old and this record represents the oldest bat record in Saskatchewan. Little Brown Bats in eastern North America have declined dramatically due to white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease responsible for the quickest wildlife die-off in history.

Bats have maximum life spans a minimum of 3 times those of nonflying eutherians - a trend resulting from neither low basal metabolic rate, the ability to enter torpor, nor large relative brain size. Marsupials live about 80\% as long as nonflying eutherians despite averaging lower basal metabolic rates; similarly, there is no effect of heterothermy or relative brain size. These results directly conflict with predictions of both 'rate of living' and brain-size mediated theories of aging.

In aquatic toxicology, behavioural tests are currently an area of controversy since inconsistent findings have been highlighted and attributed to poor quality science. The problem likely relates to limitations to our understanding of basic behavioural patterns, which can influence our ability to design statistically robust experiments yielding ecologically relevant data. The present study takes a first step towards understanding baseline behaviours in fish, including how basic choices in experimental design might influence behavioural outcomes and interpretations in aquatic toxicology. Specifically, we explored how fish acclimate to behavioural arenas and how different lengths of observation time impact estimates of basic swimming parameters (i.e., average, maximum and angular velocity). We performed a semi-quantitative literature review to place our findings in the context of the published literature describing behavioural tests with fish. Our results demonstrate that fish fundamentally change their swimming behaviour over time, and that acclimation and observational timeframes may therefore have implications for influencing both the ecological relevance and statistical robustness of behavioural toxicity tests. Our review identified 165 studies describing behavioural responses in fish exposed to various stressors, and revealed that the majority of publications documenting fish behavioural responses report extremely brief acclimation times and observational durations, which helps explain inconsistencies identified across studies. We recommend that researchers applying behavioural tests with fish, and other species, apply a similar framework to better understand baseline behaviours and the implications of design choices for influencing study outcomes.},

If so, the social attributes quantified using network statistics may themselves be personality traits. We have previously found that some social attributes of yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) may be heritable, suggesting that they are profitably viewed as reflecting individually distinctive social predispositions. Here, we asked the degree to which defensive aggression was independent of various measures of social aggression. We quantified defensive aggression when animals were live trapped and asked whether it was related to how socially tolerant marmots were. We found that although some of these social traits were epeatable, none were strongly correlated across contexts.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The gambit of the group (GoG) is a simple and useful assumption for accumulating the data necessary for a network analysis. The gambit of the group implies that each animal in a group is associating with every other individual in that group. Sampling is an important issue for networks in wild populations collected assuming GoG. Due to time, effort, and resource constraints and the difficulty of tracking animals, sampled data are usually a subset of the actual network. Ecologists often use association indexes to calculate the frequency of associations between individuals. These indexes are often transformed by applying a filter to produce a binary network. We explore GoG sampling using model networks. We examine assortment at the level of the group by a single dichotomous trait, along with many other network measures, to examine the effect of different sampling regimes, and choice of filter on the accuracy and precision with which measures are estimated. We find strong support for the use of weighted, rather than filtered, network measures and show that different filters have different effects depending on the nature of the sampling. We make several practical recommendations for ecologists planning GoG sampling. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

A good example of this trend is the use of joint species distribution models to ask questions about ecological communities. However, most current applications of model-based methods do not include phylogenies despite the well-known importance of phylogenetic relationships in shaping species distributions and community composition. In part, this is due to a lack of accessible tools allowing ecologists to fit phylogenetic species distribution models easily. To fill this gap, the r package phyr (pronounced fire) implements a suite of metrics, comparative methods and mixed models that use phylogenies to understand and predict community composition and other ecological and evolutionary phenomena. The phyr workhorse functions are implemented in C++ making all calculations and model estimations fast. phyr can fit a variety of models such as phylogenetic joint-species distribution models, spatiotemporal-phylogenetic autocorrelation models, and phylogenetic trait-based bipartite network models. phyr also estimates phylogenetically independent trait correlations with measurement error to test for adaptive syndromes and performs fast calculations of common alpha and beta phylogenetic diversity metrics. All phyr methods are united under Brownian motion or Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models of evolution, and phylogenetic terms are modelled as phylogenetic covariance matrices. The functions and model formula syntax we propose in phyr provide an easy-to-use collection of tools that we hope will ignite the use of phylogenies to address a variety of ecological questions.},

In addition to active 'fight-flight' defence responses, a passive 'freeze-hide' response is adaptive in some contexts. However, the physiological mechanisms determining which individuals choose a given defence response remain poorly understood. We examined the relationships among personality, metabolic performance and physiological stress responses across an environmental gradient in the olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. We employed four behavioural assays to document the existence of two distinct behavioural types ('bold' and 'shy') in this species. We found consistent metabolic differences between individuals of a given behavioural type across an environmental gradient: shy individuals had overall lower aerobic scope, maximum metabolic rate and standard metabolic rate than bold individuals in both high (25 ppt) and low (3 ppt) salinity. These behavioural and metabolic differences translated into divergent physiological responses during acute stress: shy individuals adopted a passive 'freeze-hide' response by reducing their oxygen consumption rates (akin to shallow breathing) whereas bold individuals adopted an active 'fight-flight' response by increasing their rates of respiration. These distinct defence strategies were repeatable within individuals between salinity treatments. Although it has been suggested theoretically, this is the first empirical evidence that the metabolic response to stressful situations differs between bold and shy individuals. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating physiological measures to understand the mechanisms driving persistent inter-individual differences in animals.},

The psychological mechanisms underlying aggression are hypothesized to be context-sensitive solutions to particular adaptive problems of social living. Seven adaptive problems are proposed for which aggression might have evolved as a solution - co-opting the resources of others, defending against attack, inflicting costs on same-sex rivals, negotiating status and power hierarchies, deterring rivals from future aggression, deterring mates from sexual infidelity, and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children. We outline several of the contexts in which humans confront these adaptive problems and the evolutionary logic of why men are cross-culturally more violently aggressive than women in particular contexts. The article concludes with a limited review of the empirical evidence surrounding each of the seven hypothesized functions of aggression and discusses the status and limitations of the current evolutionary psychological account. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {The vertebrate stress response is considered to be a highly conserved suite of responses that are evolved to help animals survive noxious environmental stimuli. The two major pathways of the stress response include the catecholamine release that is part of the autonomic nervous system and comprises the immediate fight-or-flight response, and the slower release of corticosteroids from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that help orchestrate longer-term responses. These two pathways are present in every vertebrate yet examined, and the anatomical and physiological architecture underlying these pathways are consistent. Despite these structural similarities, however, recent data indicate substantial temporal and species variation in the actual regulation of these pathways. For example, activation of both pathways varies seasonally in some species but not others, and responses of both pathways can be extensively modulated by an individual's previous experience. Consequently, even though the anatomy of the stress response is highly conserved, the activation and functional output is not highly conserved. Given this variation, it is perhaps not surprising that it is proving difficult to correlate individual stress responses with differences in fitness outcomes. This review summarizes the challenge of making broad generalized assumptions about fitness consequences of the stress response given the functional variation we observe.},

	abstract = {Examining biological diversity in an explicitly evolutionary context has been the subject of research for several decades, yet relatively recent advances in analytical techniques and the increasing availability of species-level phylogenies, have enabled scientists to ask new questions. One such approach is to quantify phylogenetic signal to determine how trait variation is correlated with the phylogenetic relatedness of species. When phylogenetic signal is high, closely related species exhibit similar traits, and this biological similarity decreases as the evolutionary distance between species increases. Here, we first review the concept of phylogenetic signal and suggest how to measure and interpret phylogenetic signal in species traits. Second, we quantified phylogenetic signal in primates for 31 variables, including body mass, brain size, life-history, sexual selection, social organization, diet, activity budget, ranging patterns and climatic variables. We found that phylogenetic signal varies extensively across and even within trait categories. The highest values are exhibited by brain size and body mass, moderate values are found in the degree of territoriality and canine size dimorphism, while low values are displayed by most of the remaining variables. Our results have important implications for the evolution of behaviour and ecology in primates and other vertebrates. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Behavior and personality play a crucial role in the evolution and ecology of animal species. We have limited knowledge of bat personality traits, partially due to the time, equipment, and facilities needed to measure them. To help fill this gap, we developed a scale for quantifying aggressiveness in bats that can be used during ordinary fieldwork and handling by researchers. This scale is based on observations of the following ecologically relevant and easily observed behaviors in wild-captured bats during routine handling: amount and intensity of physical struggling, teeth-baring, and biting. We then applied this scale to 35 wild-caught individual bats belonging to three different species or species groups (Chaerephon pumilus, n=29; Scotophilus dinganii, n=3; and pipistrelloid bats, n=3) and measured agreement between observers using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). We found that agreement between observers was good to excellent. This scale of aggressiveness provides an important, practical tool for researchers to reliably quantify this personality trait in wild bats that requires no additional equipment and minimal additional handling time. Collecting data on aggressive behavior during handling has the potential to increase our understanding of both intra- and interspecific variation in aggressiveness in bats, as well as the influence of this trait on many aspects of bat ecology. Finally, collecting data using this scale can facilitate comparisons between studies and promote research at broader spatial and temporal scales than commonly used in behavioral ecology studies.},

	abstract = {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal α = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\% of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25\% of traits) and/or ACDC (40\%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

	abstract = {Neotropical bat communities are among the most diverse mammal communities in the world, and a better understanding of these assemblages may permit inferences about how so many species coexist. While broad trophic guilds (e.g., frugivore, insectivore) of bats are recognized, details of diet and similarities among species remain largely unknown. We used stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) to characterize the community structure of a diverse Neotropical bat fauna from Belize to test predictions of niche theory and the competitive exclusion principle. We predicted that (1) interspecific variation in isotopic overlap would be greater within guilds than between guilds, and (2) no two sympatric populations would have isotopic niches that overlap completely, unless there is variation along some other axis (e.g., temporal, spatial). We additionally tested body size as an explanatory metric of potential overlap and predicted that larger-bodied animals would have greater niche breadths. Results suggest that while guild-level characterizations of communities are at least somewhat informative, there are multiple examples of intra- and inter-guild species pairs with significantly overlapping isotopic niches, suggesting that, counter to predictions, they may compete for resources. Understanding the trophic structure of animal communities is fundamental to conservation and management of endangered species and ecosystems and important for evolutionary studies, and stable isotope analyses can provide key insights as well as informing hypotheses of the diet of species that are not well known.

	abstract = {Abstract: Behavioral plasticity allows individual organisms to alter behavioral traits in response to environmental or state-dependent conditions. Structured animal personality traits often influence the degree of between-individual variation in plasticity within a population, especially as it relates to an individual’s behavioral coping style towards disturbances. Here, we investigated whether boldness and exploration measured during novel object tests in young Galápagos sea lion pups were associated with individual behavioral responses towards capture. We found that only state-related traits, such as sex and body condition, and not personality affected baseline capture responses (struggle and escape responses after release). Male pups and those that maintained good body condition tended to show initially low struggle and escape behavior. These responses, however, were not highly repeatable within individuals during the study period. Different personality types greatly differed in how they modulated their behavior over time, and few sea lions utilized fixed strategies. Unexpectedly, bolder but less explorative individuals habituated quickest to capture, while shy and explorative pups increased responses over time. Pups found to be bolder but less explorative in novel object tests also moved between fewer sites within their habitat based on observational data. This may suggest that these individuals may be less sensitive to disturbances by increasing familiarity within a limited home range. Our results illustrate that individual pups may differentially assess risk and adjust behavior to cope with disturbance within their early life environment. Significance statement: Galápagos sea lions are an endangered pinniped species which live within a habitat characterized by a large degree of environmental uncertainty. We hypothesized that, depending on their personality, Galápagos sea lion pups may show varying degrees of behavioral plasticity in response to a dynamic early life environment. We show that bold pups and those that were less explorative during novel object tests and within their natural habitat were more likely to habituate quickly to stressful experiences (i.e., a capture and handling regime). We postulate that a familiarity with the physical and social environment in addition to personality traits may play an important role in how individual sea lion pups assess and cope with early life risks.},

	abstract = {Research on live vertebrates is regulated by ethics committees, who prohibit 'excessively stressful' procedures. That judgment is based on intuition - a notoriously unreliable criterion when dealing with animals phylogenetically distant from humans. To objectively evaluate the stress imposed by research practices, we measured plasma corticosterone levels in lizards (Eulamprus heatwolei Wells \& Wellington, Scincidae). Some procedures (handling and measuring, toe-clipping for identification, exposure to predator scent) did not induce significant increases in corticosterone levels, suggesting that these stimuli generated relatively little stress. However, other stimuli (testing locomotor speed, microchip implantation, blood sampling, an unfamiliar enclosure, tail autotomy, exposure to a heterospecific lizard) were more stressful, with corticosterone levels increasing only transiently in some treatments ({\textless}2 h for tail autotomy), but persisting much longer in others (14 days for microchip implantation). Overall, our data suggest that the levels of stress induced by routine laboratory procedures are no greater than those often experienced by lizards in nature; but that intuition provides a poor basis for evaluating the levels of stress induced by research. For example, toe-clipping is often criticized and sometimes banned; but our data suggest that this method is actually less stressful than the technique frequently recommended to replace it on ethical grounds (microchip implantation). Toe-clipping also was less stressful than superficially trivial manipulations such as housing the animal in an unfamiliar enclosure. More generally, we urge researchers to seek objective information on the effects of their activities on research subjects, rather than relying upon subjectivity and anthropomorphism in making these evaluations.},

We investigate the role of diversification rate heterogeneity in shaping patterns of diversity across families of extant bats. To provide a robust framework for macroevolutionary inference, we assemble a time-calibrated, species-level phylogeny using a supermatrix of mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data. We analyze the phylogeny using a Bayesian method for modeling complex evolutionary dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that variation in family richness can largely be explained without invoking heterogeneous diversification dynamics. We document only a single well-supported shift in diversification dynamics across bats, occurring at the base of the subfamily Stenodermatinae. Bat diversity is phylogenetically imbalanced, but-contrary to previous hypotheses-this pattern is unexplained by any simple patterns of diversification rate heterogeneity. This discordance may indicate that diversification dynamics are more complex than can be captured using the statistical tools available for modeling data at this scale. We infer that bats as a whole are almost entirely united into one macroevolutionary cohort, with decelerating speciation through time. There is also a significant relationship between clade age and richness, suggesting that global bat diversity may still be expanding.},

However, long-term studies on the demographic consequences of human disturbances are unusual. We used 6 years (1995-2000) of mark-recapture data to investigate how climatic conditions, human disturbance and density affect sex- and age-specific apparent survival probabilities of the pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Schreber 1774) in a maternity colony. Our study demonstrated that density played an important role in population dynamics of pipistrelle bat and that its effect differed with respect to age and sex. Notably, human disturbance caused a strong decline of adult female survival, suggesting that perturbations have important consequences in bat-colony dynamics. Juvenile female survival was negatively influenced by density, being considerably lower in high densities. In contrast, juvenile and adult males were apparently not affected as they had constant survival probabilities. Although climatic factors can markedly affect population dynamics of temperate insectivorous bats, in this study, the weather conditions did not influence the survival rates of pipistrelle bats. We provide the first report that demonstrates the density-dependent effect on bat survival.

We demonstrate that DNAm accurately predicts chronological age. Across species, longevity is negatively associated with the rate of DNAm change at age-associated sites. Furthermore, analysis of several bat genomes reveals that hypermethylated age- and longevity-associated sites are disproportionately located in promoter regions of key transcription factors (TF) and enriched for histone and chromatin features associated with transcriptional regulation. Predicted TF binding site motifs and enrichment analyses indicate that age-related methylation change is influenced by developmental processes, while longevity-related DNAm change is associated with innate immunity or tumorigenesis genes, suggesting that bat longevity results from augmented immune response and cancer suppression.},

Humans affect groups through indirect activities, such as tourism, or directly by removing individuals through poaching, for example. These activities disturb groups in both predictable and unpredictable ways: destabilizing dominance hierarchies, changing the strength of social relationships, modifying cooperative interactions, reducing alloparental care, and altering social skills, among others.

Studies in rodents show that there are highly specific brain circuits for fear, whereas findings from human neuroimaging seem to make the opposite claim. Here, I review the field and urge three approaches that could reconcile the debates. For one, we need a broadly comparative approach that would identify core components of fear conserved across phylogeny.

	doi = {10.1159/000105485},
	abstract = {Ecological studies on feral populations of mice, fish and birds elucidate the functional significance of phenotypes that differ individually in their behavioral and neuroendocrine response to environmental challenge. Within a species, the capacity to cope with environmental challenges largely determines individual survival in the natural habitat. Recent studies indicate that individual variation within a species may buffer the species for strong fluctuations in the natural habitat. A conceptual framework will be presented that is based on the view that individual variation in aggressive behavior can be considered more generally as a variation in actively coping with environmental challenges. Highly aggressive individuals adopt a proactive coping style whereas low levels of aggression indicate a more passive or reactive style of coping. Coping styles have now been identified in a range of species and can be considered as trait characteristics that are stable over time and across situations. The dimension of coping style seems to be independent of an emotionality dimension. Hence, in the analysis of the proximate mechanisms of stress and adaptation, one has to consider the possibility that the mechanisms which determine the type of stress response might be independent from those underlying the magnitude of the response. The two coping styles differ in a number of important neurobiological and neuroendocrine systems. For example, proactive males differ significantly from reactive males in the homeostatic control of serotonergic activity resulting in completely opposite dose response relationships of various serotonergic drugs. The results so far show that proactive coping is characterized by a strong inhibitory control of the 5-HT neuron via its somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor. It is hypothesized that the regulation of serotonin release is causally related to coping style rather than emotionality. Understanding the functional individual variation as it occurs in nature and the underlying neurobiology and neuroendocrinology is fundamental in understanding individual vulnerability to stress related disease.

However, it is less widely appreciated that distinct amygdala outputs and downstream circuits are involved in different types of fear. Data show that fear of painful stimuli, predators and aggressive members of the same species are processed in independent neural circuits that involve the amygdala and downstream hypothalamic and brainstem circuits. Here, we discuss data supporting multiple fear pathways and the implications of this distributed system for understanding and treating fear. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {At a site in Costa Rica, three groups of 8-12 adult female vampire bats, Desmodus rotundus, utilize group-specific sets of hollow trees as day roosts. Long-term nonrandom associations between pairs of females, as measured by the proportion of time one bat spends roosting in the same tree with another bat over a 3 year period, occur even when preferences for particular trees are removed. Significant associations exist between both related and unrelated adult females. Adult male bats, however, show few associations with females or other males. By observing bats within trees and while foraging, and by monitoring feeding flights with radiotelemetry, the following potential benefits of association could be tested. Females roost together to (1) share a suitable microclimate, (2) avoid predators, (3) avoid ectoparasite infestations, (4) minimize travel to mobile prey animals, (5) respond to coercive males, (6) feed simultaneously from a bite, (7) remove ectoparasites by allogrooming, and (8) share food by regurgitating blood to other bats within roosts. The data do not indicate that any of the first five hypotheses provide significant benefits for long-term associations although predators and ectoparasite levels may cause occasional changes in roost sites. Simultaneous feeding was uncommon and apparently confined to females and their recent offspring. Allogrooming, although common, occurred independently of the presence of ectoparasites. Food sharing, however, occurred between both related and unrelated adult females with high levels of association and provides at least one selective advantage for maintaining cohesive female groups. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.},

Pteronotus davyi currently includes two morphologically differentiated subspecies, P. d. davyi and P. d. incae, with strikingly disjunct geographic ranges. Whereas the nominotypical form is found in Central America, the Caribbean coastal region of northern South America, and the Lesser Antilles, the subspecies P. d. incae is restricted to a small area in northwestern Peru; to date, the phylogenetic relationships of these nominal taxa have not been explored. In the present contribution, we employed analyses of mitochondrial gene sequences, morphometrics, and qualitative-morphological comparisons to provide new information on P. d. incae and place the taxon in a phylogenetic context. Our results suggest that the geographically disjunct populations of P. davyi are genetically very similar even though they are morphologically and ecologically distinct. Recognizing that speciation is a process with intermediate stages that merit formal recognition, we support the retention of incae as a valid subspecies of Pteronotus davyi. ©},

	abstract = {Stable social bonds in group-living animals can provide greater access to food. A striking example is that female vampire bats often regurgitate blood to socially bonded kin and nonkin that failed in their nightly hunt. Food-sharing relationships form via preferred associations and social grooming within roosts. However, it remains unclear whether these cooperative relationships extend beyond the roost. To evaluate if long-term cooperative relationships in vampire bats play a role in foraging, we tested if foraging encounters measured by proximity sensors could be explained by wild roosting proximity, kinship, or rates of co-feeding, social grooming, and food sharing during 21 months in captivity. We assessed evidence for 6 hypothetical scenarios of social foraging, ranging from individual to collective hunting. We found that closely bonded female vampire bats departed their roost separately, but often reunited far outside the roost. Repeating foraging encounters were predicted by within-roost association and histories of cooperation in captivity, even when accounting for kinship. Foraging bats demonstrated both affiliative and competitive interactions with different social calls linked to each interaction type. We suggest that social foraging could have implications for social evolution if “local” within-roost cooperation and “global” outside-roost competition enhances fitness interdependence between frequent roostmates.},

Sixty-four video recordings made at three separate foliage roosts during 1 year showed that group size varied between two and 14 individuals. One male was regularly observed roosting with more females than others, and this male was associated with the highest quality roost, defined here as the highest, most structurally stable, and least disturbed. Males invariably occupied exclusive roosts during the study, whereas females frequently moved among adjacent roosts. The high roost fidelity of males appears to be related to the defense of the highest quality roosts. Because females were observed roosting with each of the three males present at the study site, female groups were considered unstable. We suggest that shuttling movements of individuals may reflect a commonly observed adaptation of foliage roosting bats related to the avoidance of predators and/or parasites. The type of male-female association observed in A. lituratus is consistent with a resource defense polygyny hypothesis. © 2007 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.},

Objective: To describe the reproductive patterns and population dynamics of seven bat species (Artibeus toltecus, Carollia perspicillata, Glossophaga soricina, Mormoops megalophylla, Pteronotus fulvus, Pteronotus mesoamericanus and Natalus mexicanus) that roost in one mine (La Mina) and two caves (El Apanguito and Cerro Huatulco) in the State of Oaxaca, in Southeastern México. Methods: Sampling was conducted monthly from July 2016 to June 2017. Bats were captured using a harp trap, which was placed at the entrance of the roosts. The captured bats were identified using taxonomic keys, marked with an aluminum ring, sex and age class were also determined. Reproductive activity was modeled through 63 GLMs for each species (504 in total). The best model was selected according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Results: A total of 5 836 bats were captured and marked, classified into 14 species, 10 genera, and five families. The most abundant species were: P. fulvus and P. mesoamericanus, representing 41 \% and 32.3 \% of the captures, respectively. The mormopids M. megalophylla, P. fulvus, P. mesoamericanus, together with N. mexicanus showed a restricted seasonal monoestrous pattern, while the phyllostomids A. toltecus, C. perspicillata, and G. soricina showed a seasonal bimodal polyoestry pattern. The monthly abundance of species fluctuated significantly (H= 13, df= 11, P= 0.044) in the three roosts throughout the entire study period and the best supported GLM that included the seven species showed that the six chosen variables (season, sex, roost, temperature, precipitation and humidity) were positively associated with reproductive activity. Conclusions: The reproductive activity of each species seems to be synchronized with the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season, as well as influenced by factors such as temperature, humidity and roost site.},

	abstract = {Population dynamics, roost selection and reproductive patterns of some cave bats from Western of Mexico. Almost half of bat species that occur in Mexico use caves as permanent or temporal roosts. However, the ecological studies about cave bat communities are scarce. In this work we studied the population dynamics, roost selection and reproductive patterns of some bats present in El Salitre Cave, Colima, Mexico. We carried out monthly samplings between August 2003-March 2005 using a harp trap for bats capture, we took their biological data and marked some of them with plastic rings. We also explored the cave to locate bat colonies and register microclimatic conditions in each cave section. We captured a total of 16 409 bats of which 31\% were Mormoops megalophylla, 24.5\% Pteronotus personatus, 23\% P. davyi, 8.2\% P. parnellii, 5.8\% Natalus mexicanus and 5.3\% Glossophaga soricina. Macrotus waterhousii, G. morenoi, Desmodus rotundus, Balantiopteryx plicata, and Glyphonycteris sylvestris represented only 2.2\% of the captures. Some bat species used the cave as a permanent day roost while others as a seasonal one, and their population size varied markedly along the year and between rainy and dry seasons. Most bat population peaks were linked with their reproductive periods. The Pteronotus species and N. mexicanus exhibited sexual segregation during the breeding season. The mormoopids and N. mexicanus occupied deeper parts of the cave with temperatures {\textgreater}25.8 degrees C and relative humidity {\textgreater}99\%. The phyllostomids occupied intermediate sections where the ambient was less hot and humid, with temperatures of 23.2-28.3 degrees C and humidity of 74-89.9\%. Some individuals of B. plicata and G. sylvestris were seen occasionally occupying one chamber near the entrance two, where temperature and humidity were of 23.2 degrees C and 84.2\%, respectively. The mormoopids and N. mexicanus showed a pattern of seasonal monoestry, synchronized with rainy season. Glossophaga soricina had a pattern of bimodal seasonal poliestry, with one reproductive peak to early of dry season and another to last of this season. Macrotus waterhousii did not exhibit a seasonal pattern, with parturitions occurring throughout the year. Our results indicate a seasonal replacement between several species as well as seasonal movements to other caves. The data indicate that the carrying capacity of the cave is mainly determined by the availability of roosting sites. The selection of roosting sites is linked to the close relationship between microclimatic conditions and the species physiological characteristics.

Even though distress calls have been studied for a long time, their precise advantage for callers or the significance for receivers is still unclear. In this study, we describe distress calls of the nectarivorous bat Glossophaga soricina (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae). Analysing 1925 distress call syllables from 15 individuals caught in the field, we defined six different syllable types. Distress calls were high-intensity, broadband sounds with a low frequency range and thus comparable to those of other taxa. We found statistical evidence for an individual signature in distress calls, but not for a sex-specific signature. Further, playback experiments revealed that group-housed bats responded to distress calls, whereas single-housed bats did not, suggesting that the bats’ response behaviour is influenced by group size. Bats responded significantly to normal and distorted conspecific distress calls but not to heterospecific distress calls. We found no sex-specific differences in the response to different playback stimuli. In conclusion, our results indicate that distress calls of bats encode important social information that can be used by receivers and that the response behaviour of receivers depends on the presence of conspecifics.},

	abstract = {Cryptic species, defined as those that are morphologically indistinguishable but phylogenetically distinct, are common in bats and correspond to the majority of newly described species. Such seems to be the case of Glossophaga soricina, a generalist, glossophagine bat that is broadly distributed throughout the Neotropics. Several studies have found high levels of molecular variation within G. soricina, suggesting that it could be a cryptic species complex. Here, we explore data derived from two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of cranial characters and their covariation with environmental variables, aiming to test the existence of more than one species grouped within it and to contribute to the knowledge of its variation and evolutionary history. Variation in shape and size of skull and mandible supports the two main mitochondrial lineages reported in previous studies, one corresponding to the east side of the Andes (subspecies G. s. soricina) and the other one corresponding to populations from Mesoamerica and the west side of the Andes, in turn composed of at least three monophyletic and morphologically differentiated taxa. Environmental variables correlate with shape variation and might be responsible for convergences in shape and size between the species with the smallest distributions. Based on the evidence we present in this work we elevate four subspecies to the taxonomic level of species. The correct names for the species of the analyzed complex are: G. soricina (Pallas 1766), G. mutica Merriam 1898, G. antillarum Rehn 1902, and G. valens Miller 1913.},

	abstract = {The diurnal behavior of members of a harem group of the big fruit-eating bat, Artibeus lituratus, in Mérida, Venezuela was investigated while they roosted beneath palm leaves. Behaviors were recorded applying a digital video camera to characterize diurnal activities, and from these an ethogram was constructed. Scan sampling and focal sampling were used to analyze the recorded behaviors. Four long behavioral states and seven short behavioral events were distinguished. During the diurnal period, most bats were inactive and were presumed to be sleeping, although at least one individual always remained active and alert. The fact that at least one bat was always alert during the day-roosting period suggests that some level of vigilance may be needed for bats to successfully occupy exposed roosts. Although the bats were inactive more than 80\% of the day-roosting period, this was an interrupted phenomenon since individuals did not sleep continuously for more than 20 min (on average) when they were observed sleeping. Differences between the single harem male and an associated female were significant in terms of the frequency of states and events, and duration of some behavioral states. The harem male was active (i.e. alert) 13\% of time of the diurnal period, whereas the female was active 1\% of the time during this same period. Differences may be related to predation risks or actual and potential incursions of other males into the roost. The male allocated 4\% of his time to grooming, whereas the female allocated 9\% of her time to grooming, which may be related to the female's reproductive condition. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.},

In two caves of the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, we found Jamaican fruit-eating bats forming harem groups, consisting of 4-18 females and 1-2 males, inside solution cavities that develop on the ceiling of caves. Other individuals roosted solitarily in the same caves, but outside solution cavities. We identified three types of males: dominants (one in each harem group), subordinates (present only in the largest harems), and satellites (not associated with a harem). Dominants were larger and heavier than males of the other two categories. During the 2-year study, harem groups always roosted in the same cavity and presented a high degree of stability, with few changes in composition. Satellite males and solitary females, in contrast, shifted roosting sites frequently and never formed cohesive groups. Adult females performed more movements from and to harem groups than males, and those movements were less frequent during the breeding season. Harems of the Jamaican fruit-eating bat presented subordinate males in large groups and differ from those of other phyllostomids in the lower degree of cohesiveness shown by females.},

	abstract = {Saccopteryx bilineata has a polygynous mating system in which males defend females in a harem territory. Harem defense and courtship include energetically costly flight maneuvers and hovering displays. We tested if (1) harem males have a greater field metabolic rate than non-harem males or females and if (2) the field metabolic rate of harem males is correlated with the number of females in a harem territory. We measured the energy budget in 32 S. bilineata with the doubly labeled water method and compared these estimates with behavioral observations in the daytime roost. Among adult bats, field metabolic rate varied with body mass by an exponent of approximately two. We found no significant difference in field metabolic rate or mass-specific field metabolic rate between harem and non-harem males. The mass-specific field metabolic rate of harem-males increased with harem size. The latter finding supports the hypothesis that the energy costs of courtship display and territorial defense influence the energy budget of harem males. Overall, field metabolic rates of S. bilineata were lower than those of similarly sized bats of the temperate zone and only 2.3 times above the basal metabolic rate recorded for this species. We suggest that male S. bilineata did not take advantage of their metabolic capacity because a prudent allocation of energy to activities of harem maintenance is an adaptive strategy for males in this mating system.},

Briefly, a fish is placed in a central compartment of a half-black, half-white tank; following habituation, the fish is allowed to explore the tank for 15 min; the number and duration of entries in each compartment (white or black) are recorded by the observer for the whole session. Zebrafish, goldfish, guppies and tilapias (all species that are important in behavioral neurosciences and neuroethology) have been shown to demonstrate a marked preference for the dark compartment. An increase in white compartment activity (duration and/or entries) should reflect antianxiety behavior, whereas an increase in dark compartment activity should reflect anxiety-promoting behavior.

The use of social information by foraging bats was documented in insectivorous, carnivorous and frugivorous species, but there are little data whether flower-visiting nectarivorous bats (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) can acquire information about food from other individuals. In this study, we conducted an experiment with a demonstrator-observer paradigm to investigate whether flower-visiting Pallas’ long-tongued bats (Glossophaga soricina) are able to socially learn novel flower positions via observation of, or interaction with, knowledgeable conspecifics. The results demonstrate that flower-visiting G. soricina are able to use social information for the location of novel flower positions and can thereby reduce energy-costly search efforts. This social transmission is explainable as a result of local enhancement; learning bats might rely on both visual and echo-acoustical perception and are likely to eavesdrop on auditory cues that are emitted by feeding conspecifics. We additionally tested the spatial memory capacity of former demonstrator bats when retrieving a learned flower position, and the results indicate that flower-visiting bats remember a learned flower position after several weeks.},

The results obtained showed that, as expected, innovation team climate moderated the relationship between education level diversity and team communication quality, as well as the indirect effect linking education level diversity, team communication quality, and team performance. Practitioner points: This study informs team managers about the contingent influence of education level diversity on work teams' functioning that should be taken into account when forming and managing teams composed of individuals with different levels of formal education. Education level diversity was found to influence team communication quality and performance positively when the level of innovation team climate was high, but negatively when it was low. Therefore, team managers should foster innovation climates in teams with members who have different levels of education. The aforementioned influence of education level diversity was transmitted through intrateam communication quality. Therefore, team managers should enhance the latter variable within educationally diverse teams.},

The four-factor theory of facet-specific climate for innovation, which was derived from these reviews, is described, and the procedures used to operationalize this model into the original version measure described. Data attesting to underlying factor structure, internal homogeneity, predictive validity and factor replicability across groups of the summarized measure are presented. An initial sample of 155 individuals from 27 hospital management teams provided data for the exploratory factor analysis of this measure. Responses from 121 further groups in four occupations (35 primary health care teams, 42 social services teams, 20 psychiatric teams and 24 oil company teams; total N = 971) were used to apply confirmatory factor analysis techniques. This five-factor, 38-item summarized version demonstrates robust psychometric properties, with acceptable levels of reliability and validity.

We examined how team climate mediates the associations between team diversity and three outcomes: satisfaction with the team, satisfaction with authorship practices, and perceptions of the frequency of data sharing. Using path analyses, we found that individuals from underrepresented groups perceived team climate more negatively, which was associated with lower satisfaction with the team and more negative perceptions of authorship practices and data sharing on the team. However, individuals on teams with more demographic diversity reported a more positive climate than those on teams with less demographic diversity. These results highlight the importance of team climate, the value of diverse teams for team climate, and barriers to the full inclusion and support of individuals from underrepresented groups in interdisciplinary science teams.},

	abstract = {Stakeholder theory has received greater scholarly and practitioner attention as organizations consider the interests of various groups affected by corporate operations, including employees. This study investigates two dimensions of psychological climate, specifically perceived pay equity and diversity climate, for one such stakeholder group: racioethnic minority professionals. We examined the main effect of U.S. professionals’ of color pay equity perceptions, and the influence of perceived internal and external pay equity on turnover intentions. We also investigated the interactive effect of perceptions of pay equity and diversity climate on turnover intentions. Results indicated that pay equity perceptions were negatively associated with turnover intentions. Our findings showed that perceptions of internal pay equity influenced turnover intentions but perceptions of external equity did not. Further, perceptions of pay equity and the diversity climate interactively influenced turnover intentions. Participants who reported an unfavorable diversity climate and a low perceived pay equity were most likely to report turnover intentions. Simple slope analysis for moderate pay equity also was significant. When perceived pay equity was high, favorability of the diversity climate did not affect turnover intentions. The findings have useful practical implications. When pay was perceived as equitable, participants appeared to pay less attention to the diversity climate. Employee pay equity perceptions may be malleable; sharing information with employees about pay levels during performance reviews may enhance perceptions of pay equity. The findings suggest that, consistent with stakeholder theory, organizations should attend to perceptions of both pay equity and diversity climate when striving to minimize the turnover intentions of professionals of color.},

Phylogenetic trees are essential to understand the processes of community or network assembly, to identify centers of diversification, and to help protect Earth’s evolutionary heritage. Despite two decades of research and syntheses, there are still many discussions on how phylogenetic diversity (PD) methods should be effectively applied to those fields. In particular, conservation approaches based on PD have become similar to these used in community ecology. Thus, the main benefit of using PD calculations in conservation biology may have been ignored or misinterpreted. Our goal is to discuss and provide guidelines to the use of PD in biodiversity conservation so that its benefits are not hidden or lost in the approaches employed. We also aim that benefits and uses are better recognized and more easily understood by researchers or practitioners who would like to include PD in their studies and conservation planning.},

The size of the colonies varied monthly, indicating the occurrence of frequent movements among caves and a low degree of roost fidelity for the commonest species: Desmodus rotundus, Carollia perspicillata, Anoura caudifer, Artibeus fimbriatus. Phyllostomines (Trachops cirrhosus, Chrotopterus auritus) and Peropteryx macrotis seem more sedentary, as suggested by their higher recapture rates. D. rotundus uses multiple roosts, mostly within relatively small areas, with a 2-3 km radius. These vampires move preferentially along valleys, males moving more than females. Frequency of movements is probably related to the availability of roosts and climate. The climate of the Alto Ribeira is subtropical, with cool nights during the ''dry'' season, when part of the vampire population (and other species as well) would migrate to warmer regions. Recapture races and the estimated individual ranges are similar to those observed for this species in other regions. The minimum population density of D. rotundus varied monthly from one to 3.5 individuals per km(2). Diphylla ecandata moves more frequently and probably has larger individual ranges than D. rotundus, possibly due to its higher feeding specialization.},

	abstract = {The number of species that merit conservation interventions is increasing daily with ongoing habitat destruction, increased fragmentation and loss of population connectivity. Desertification and climate change reduce suitable conservation areas. Physiological stress is an inevitable part of the capture and translocation process of wild animals. Globally, capture myopathy - a malignant outcome of stress during capture operations - accounts for the highest number of deaths associated with wildlife translocation. These deaths may not only have considerable impacts on conservation efforts but also have direct and indirect financial implications. Such deaths usually are indicative of how well animal welfare was considered and addressed during a translocation exercise. Importantly, devastating consequences on the continued existence of threatened and endangered species succumbing to this known risk during capture and movement may result. Since first recorded in 1964 in Kenya, many cases of capture myopathy have been described, but the exact causes, pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment for this condition remain to be adequately studied and fully elucidated. Capture myopathy is a condition with marked morbidity and mortality that occur predominantly in wild animals around the globe. It arises from inflicted stress and physical exertion that would typically occur with prolonged or short intense pursuit, capture, restraint or transportation of wild animals. The condition carries a grave prognosis, and despite intensive extended and largely non-specific supportive treatment, the success rate is poor. Although not as common as in wildlife, domestic animals and humans are also affected by conditions with similar pathophysiology. This review aims to highlight the current state of knowledge related to the clinical and pathophysiological presentation, potential treatments, preventative measures and, importantly, the hypothetical causes and proposed pathomechanisms by comparing conditions found in domestic animals and humans. Future comparative strategies and research directions are proposed to help better understand the pathophysiology of capture myopathy.},

	abstract = {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal α = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\% of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25\% of traits) and/or ACDC (40\%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

	abstract = {Definitions of interdisciplinarity often focus on the integration of disciplinary concepts or perspectives. Few definitions, however, are grounded in the work of faculty who conduct interdisciplinary scholarship. To better understand the practice of interdisciplinarity in research and teaching, and its implications for academics' professional lives, I interviewed college and university faculty affiliated with a variety of liberal arts and sciences disciplines in four U.S. institutions of varying size and mission. The study explored how interviewees practiced interdisciplinarity; how institutional, departmental, and disciplinary locations affected their scholarly identities, professional associations, and work lives; and the kinds of rewards they reaped from interdisciplinary work. In this article, I analyze a subset of the interviews, examining explicit and implied definitions of interdisciplinarity and their relationship to faculty members' understandings of disciplinarity and scholarly work. The analysis reveals that definitions of interdisciplinarity that emphasize integration exclude some forms of interdisciplinary work. I therefore suggest an alternative, more inclusive conceptualization that strives to encompass a range of interdisciplinary practices. Further study of interdisciplinary research and teaching might confirm that all interdisciplinary scholarship can be categorized according to the typology described here – or it might provide evidence of additional forms of interdisciplinarity.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behavior and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather nondispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships.

	abstract = {Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag technology permits the “resighting” of animals tagged for ecological research without the need for physical re-trapping. Whilst this is effective if animals pass within centimeters of tag readers, short-distance detection capabilities have prevented the use of this technology with many species. To address this problem, we optimized a large (15 m long) flexible antenna system to provide a c. 8 m2 vertical detection plane for detecting animals in flight. We installed antennas at two roosting caves, including the primary maternity cave, of the critically endangered southern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus orianae bassanii) in south-eastern Australia. Testing of these systems indicated PIT-tags could be detected up to 105 cm either side of the antenna plane. Over the course of a three-year study, we subcutaneously PIT-tagged 2,966 bats and logged over 1.4 million unique detections, with 97\% of tagged bats detected at least once. The probability of encountering a tagged bat decreased with increasing environmental “noise” (unwanted signal) perceived by the system. During the study, we mitigated initial high noise levels by earthing both systems, which contributed to an increase in daily detection probability (based on the proportion of individuals known to be alive that were detected each day) from {\textless}0.2 (noise level ≥30\%) to 0.7–0.8 (noise level 5\%–15\%). Conditional on a low (5\%) noise level, model-based estimates of daily encounter probability were highest ({\textgreater}0.8) during peak breeding season when both female and male southern bent-winged bats congregate at the maternity cave. In this paper, we detail the methods employed and make methodological recommendations for future wildlife research using large antennas, including earthing systems as standard protocol and quantifying noise metrics as a covariate influencing the probability of detection in subsequent analyses. Our results demonstrate that large PIT antennas can be used successfully to detect small volant species, extending the scope of PIT technology and enabling a much broader range of wildlife species to be studied using this approach.},

	abstract = {Social network analyses allow studying the processes underlying the associations between individuals and the consequences of those associations. Constructing and analyzing social networks can be challenging, especially when designing new studies as researchers are confronted with decisions about how to collect data and construct networks, and the answers are not always straightforward. The current lack of guidance on building a social network for a new study system might lead researchers to try several different methods and risk generating false results arising from multiple hypotheses testing. Here, we suggest an approach for making decisions when starting social network research in a new study system that avoids the pitfall of multiple hypotheses testing. We argue that best edge definition for a network is a decision that can be made using a priori knowledge about the species and that is independent from the hypotheses that the network will ultimately be used to evaluate. We illustrate this approach with a study conducted on a colonial cooperatively breeding bird, the sociable weaver. We first identified two ways of collecting data using different numbers of feeders and three ways to define associations among birds. We then evaluated which combination of data collection and association definition maximized (a) the assortment of individuals into previously known “breeding groups” (birds that contribute toward the same nest and maintain cohesion when foraging) and (b) socially differentiated relationships (more strong and weak relationships than expected by chance). This evaluation of different methods based on a priori knowledge of the study species can be implemented in a diverse array of study systems and makes the case for using existing, biologically meaningful knowledge about a system to help navigate the myriad of methodological decisions about data collection and network inference.},

	abstract = {We present an interdisciplinary effort to record feeding behaviors and control the diet of a hummingbird species (Phaethornis longirostris, the long-billed hermit or LBH) by developing a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based smart feeder. The system contains an RFID reader, a microcontroller, and a servo-controlled hummingbird feeder opener; the system is presented as a tool for studying the cognitive ability of the LBH species. When equipped with glass capsule RFID tags (which are mounted on the hummingbird), the smart feeder can provide specific diets for predetermined sets of hummingbirds at the discretion of biologists. This is done by reading the unique RFID tag on the hummingbirds and comparing the ID number with the pre-programmed ID numbers stored in the smart feeder. The smart feeder records the time and ID of each hummingbird visit. The system data is stored in a readily available SD card and is powered by two 9 V batteries. The detection range of the system is approximately 9–11 cm. Using this system, biologists can assign the wild hummingbirds to different experimental groups and monitor their diets to determine if they develop a preference to any of the available nectars. During field testing, the smart feeder system has demonstrated consistent detection (when compared to detections observed by video-recordings) of RFID tags on hummingbirds and provides pre-designed nectars varying water and sugar concentrations to target individuals. The smart feeder can be applied to other biological and environmental studies in the future.},

	abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been broadly applied in the biological sciences to yield new insights into behavior, cognition, population biology, and distributions. RFID systems entail wireless communication between small tags that, when stimulated by an appropriate radio frequency transmission, emit a weak, short-range wireless signal that conveys a unique ID number. These tags, which often operate without a battery, can be attached to animals such that their presence at a particular location can be detected by an RFID reader. This paper describes an RFID data-logging system that can serve as the core for a wide variety of field and laboratory applications for monitoring the activities of individual animals. The core electronics are modeled on an Arduino circuit board, which is a hobbyist electronics system. Users can customize the hardware and software to accommodate their needs. We demonstrate the utility of the system with cursory descriptions of three real-world research applications. The first is a large-scale deployment that was used to examine individual breeding behaviors across four local populations of Wood Ducks. The second application employed an array of RFID-enabled bird feeders that allowed for tests of spatial cognition. Third, we describe a nest-box monitoring system that both records visits from breeding birds and administers experimental treatments, such as increasing temperature or playing audio recordings, in accordance to the presence/absence of individual birds. With these examples we do not attempt to relate details with regard to research findings; rather our intent is to demonstrate some of the possibilities enabled by our low-cost RFID system. Detailed descriptions, design files, and code are made available by means of the Open Science Framework.},

	abstract = {Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has gained popularity in ornithological studies as a way to collect large quantities of data to answer specific biological questions, but few published studies report methodologies used for validating the accuracy of RFID data. Further, connections between the RFID data and the behaviors of interest in a study are not always clearly established. These methodological deficiencies may seriously impact a study's results and subsequent interpretation. We built RFID-equipped bird feeders and mounted them at three sites in Tompkins County, New York. We deployed passive integrated transponder tags on black-capped chickadees, tufted titmice, and white-breasted nuthatches and used a GoPro video camera to record the three tagged species at the feeders. We then reviewed the video to determine the accuracy of the RFID reader and understand the birds’ behavior at the feeders. We found that our RFID system recorded only 34.2\% of all visits by tagged birds (n = 237) and that RFID detection increased with the length of a visit. We also found that our three tagged species and two other species that visited the feeders, American goldfinch and hairy woodpecker, retrieved food in 79.5\% of their visits. Chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, and woodpeckers spent, on average, 2.3 s at feeders to collect one seed per visit. In contrast, goldfinches spent an average of 9.0 s at feeders and consumed up to 30 seeds per visit. Our results demonstrate the importance of confirming detection accuracy and that video can be used to identify behavioral characteristics associated with an RFID reader's detections. This simple—yet time-intensive—method for assessing the accuracy and biological meaning of RFID data is useful for ornithological studies but can be used in research focusing on various taxa and study systems.},

Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags (or microchips) generally have high retention rates; however, tag loss rates for small mammals such as insectivorous bats are poorly understood. We double-marked a population of Gould's wattled bats (Chalinolobus gouldii) with forearm bands and PIT tags (with the injection site sealed with surgical adhesive) in January and February 2020 to determine rates of subsequent tag loss over the short- (1–2 months) and medium- (13–14 months) term. Loss of PIT tags occurred in 4 (2.7\%) of 146 recaptured individuals, all within 2 months of microchipping. We also recorded 1 occurrence of band loss 11 months after banding. Our study supports assertions that PIT-tag retention rates in small mammals are high, and suggests that rates of tag loss in small bat species are low when surgical adhesive is applied.

Manual leukocyte counts are required in reptiles, however, disagreement between quantification methods has been observed in some chelonians. This study determined agreement between two methods of leukocyte quantification, eosinophilic leukopet, and blood film white blood cell (WBC) estimates, in free-living eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina). Simultaneously, we assessed the impact of handling duration on both leukocyte quantity and corticosterone levels. We collected blood at capture ({\textless}2 min from disturbance) and again before release 30–150 min later from 92 box turtles at six sites in Illinois and Tennessee. Constant and proportional error was present in the leukopet results for WBC, lymphocytes, and basophils compared to the estimate method. Both methods were in agreement for heterophils, monocytes, and eosinophils. Agreement between the methods was significantly more likely at WBC counts below 23,241/µl. All hematologic parameters were significantly higher at the final blood draw compared to the initial blood draw using both WBC determination methods, except relative eosinophil and basophil counts. Corticosterone levels varied with time, with maximum concentrations reached at 54 min postcapture, followed by a rapid return to baseline levels. Corticosterone level was not significantly associated with any hematologic parameter or sex. This study provides a framework for understanding the effects of animal handling methodology and diagnostic modality when evaluating hematologic health in box turtles.},

However, often these activities place nonhuman animals under considerable physical or psychological distress, which disrupts normal patterns of behavior and may ultimately result in deleterious effects on animal welfare and the validity of research results. Thus, knowledge of how trapping, handling, and tagging alter the behavior of research animals is essential if measures to ameliorate stress-related effects are to be developed and implemented. This article describes how time-stamped location data obtained by global-positioning-system telemetry can be used to retrospectively characterize acute behavioral responses to trapping, handling, and tagging in free-ranging animals used for research. Methods are demonstrated in a case study of the common brushtail possum, a semiarboreal phalangerid marsupial native to Australia.

	abstract = {Capture and handling of wildlife is often an important component of studies where detailed demographic, behavioral, physiological, or health data are required. Yet, capturing and handling wildlife is sometimes controversial and lacking public support because of concern about effects on individuals. Investigating potential effects of capturing wildlife is also important to inform data-censoring protocols when using information obtained from captured animals. We investigated the short-term effect of helicopter-based capture and handling on movements of free-ranging bison (Bison bison) that were chemically immobilized in Yukon, Canada. We examined daily movement rates, home range size, and displacement of global positioning system-collared individuals immediately after capture and for 20 days thereafter. Our results indicate that there is a minimal short-term effect of helicopter-based capture on bison movements. Significant differences from apparent pre-capture movement behavior were observed only within 24 hours after capture. We observed variation among individuals, however, with some animals taking up to 10 days to return to apparent pre-capture movement rates, whereas others had no measurable response to capture. Despite individual variation, {\textgreater}80\% of individuals had returned to apparent pre-capture movement behavior within the first 5 days after capture. Furthermore, sex-based effects were evident: females increased their daily movement rates, home range size, and displacement after capture, whereas males had either no effect or decreased movement rates. Our results suggest that movement rates are altered for only a short period after capture and, therefore, should not have severe negative effects on bison using our protocols. Accordingly, researchers should censor the first 10 days after capture from their analyses to avoid using biased information. Our study should also help inform public discourse regarding capturing and handling wildlife for research or management purposes. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.},

Extreme exertion dur- ing restraint and transport can lead to acidosis and free radical production that result in muscle tissue damage. This condition, termed capture myopathy, can result in dyspnea, hyperthermia, weakness, muscle rigidity, and col- lapse. These complications could lead to increased susceptibility of individuals to predation or contribute to death weeks or months after capture. Death caused by capture could negatively bias mortality rate estimates if mortali- ties occur after traditional censor periods. We hypothesize that muscular damage incurred during capture handi- caps northern bobwhites. We evaluated our hypothesis by comparing survival of northern bobwhite that were treat- ed for muscular damage with an injection of vitamin E and selenium, a solution recommended in veterinary avian medicine, with bobwhites that were not treated. We captured northern bobwhite during 2002 and 2003 and inject- ed half of the birds with 0.1 ml of a vitamin E and selenium solution and the other half with a saline control. We then transported these birds to our study site and monitored them using radiotelemetry. We estimated survival rates using the staggered-entry Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimator. The survival of treated birds was greater than the survival of control birds in 2002 at days 45 (58\% vs. 29\%, Z = 1.98, P = 0.05) and 66 (53\% vs. 29\%, Z = 1.79, P = 0.07), a period before and after which sample sizes were very small. Treated birds exhibited a greater (χ2 = 7.11, P {\textless}0.008) survival curve than control birds during 2003 and when treatments were pooled by year (χ2 = 4.19, P = 0.04).

Of 151 telemetered birds, 23 (15.2\%) exhibited impaired mobility and coordination after release, probably related to the occurrence of capture myopathy. Among the 23 impaired birds, 10 (43.5\%) died before recovering normal mobility (6.6\% of all birds captured). Logistic regression analyses identified longer handling time, longer restraint time, use of cannon nets, and capture of juveniles as inducing factors for these disorders. We conclude that little bustard is fairly susceptible to suffering ataxia and paresia after release as a result of restraint associated with capture and manipulation. Researchers can reduce this risk by keeping handling and restraint time below 10-20 minutes, particularly when using cannon nets or when capturing juveniles.},

	abstract = {Capture and handling of wildlife is an important component of wildlife studies, and hunting can be a central tool for wildlife management. However, human-caused disturbance of animals can cause various negative effects on individuals. Thus, an increased understanding of different disturbances on animals will allow improved mitigation of human stressors for wildlife, and provides the basis for data-censoring when using information obtained from captured individuals. Here, we investigated the effects of capture and handling, as well as experimental disturbance, on the movement behavior of GPS-collared European hares Lepus europaeus. Of 28 hares captured in box traps, three died during handling to fit GPS collars, likely due to acute stress. Apart from an 11\% decrease in activity in both sexes the first four days after capture compared to later, capture events had no significant effects on subsequent movement behavior. Hares that were disturbed experimentally, i.e. flushed with or without a shotgun shot fired, moved on average (± SD) 422 ± 206 m directly subsequent to the disturbance, leading to a spatial displacement of their short-term home range and an increased daily home range size on the disturbance day. Home range sizes returned to their before disturbance size on the following days, but hares remained further from field edges and spent more time in short vegetation in the days after simulated hunting, though this effect was comparatively small. Overall, our findings indicate that hares only marginally changed their movement behavior in response to short-term disturbances. Therefore, capture and hunting disturbance should not have severe negative effects on the movement behavior of individuals, but future studies should aim to reduce acute capture-related stress to avoid mortalities. We recommend that researchers should censor the first four days after capture from their analyses to avoid using potentially biased data.},

	abstract = {The importance of capturing wild animals for research and conservation projects is widely shared. As this activity continues to become more common, the need to assess its negative effects increases so as to ensure ethical standards and the validity of research results. Increasing evidence has revealed that indirect (physiological and behavioural) effects of capture are as important as direct risks (death or injury) and that different capture methodologies can cause heterogeneous effects. We investigated the influence of chemical immobilisation on Alpine ibex (Capra ibex): during the days following the capture we collected data on spatial behaviour, activity levels of both males and females, and male hormone levels. Moreover, we recorded the reproductive status of each marked female during the breeding seasons of 15 years. Then, by several a priori models we investigated the effects of the capture taking into account biological factors and changes in environmental conditions. Our results showed that chemical immobilisation did not affect either spatial behaviour (for both males and females) or male hormone levels, though both sexes showed reduced activity levels up to two days after the capture. The capture did not significantly affect the likelihood for a female to give birth in the following summer. Our findings highlighted the scarce impact of chemical immobilisation on ibex biology, as we detected alteration of activity levels only immediately after the capture if compared to the following days (i.e., baseline situation). Hence, the comparison of our findings with previous research showed that our methodology is one of the less invasive procedures to capture large mammals. Nonetheless, in areas characterised by high predator density, we suggest that animals released be carefully monitored for some hours after the capture. Moreover, researchers should avoid considering data collected during the first days after the manipulation in order to avoid biased information.},

This complex maternal behavior adversely affects the accuracy, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and consequently the overall value of behavioral and survival studies. To follow-up on a previous study where we reported an 18.4\% rate of abandonment of moose (Alces alces) neonates following helicopter-assisted capture in Minnesota, USA, we tracked the movement behavior of 12 and 13 moose neonates fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars during 8–15 May 2014 (phase 1) and 21 May–19 June (phase 2), respectively. These efforts were part of an overall study of reproductive success and cause-specific mortality in Minnesota's remaining viable but declining moose population. During phase 1, 7 (3 M, 4 F) of 12 (6 M, 6 F) neonates were abandoned by 5 of 9 dams. Our capture-induced abandonment contingency plan and monitoring of hourly location fixes of the GPS-collared newborns and their dams allowed us to recover 6 of the 7 abandoned neonates alive and in good condition. During phase 2, we reduced our capture team from 3 to 4 to 2 persons and limited handling to fitting the GPS collar and sexing the neonate (x = 0.7 min). Capture-induced abandonment decreased to 1 of 10 dams abandoning a set of twins. Mean distance of dams to capture site (calving site) 1 hour pre- and 1 hour post-capture did not indicate a predisposition to abandonment. However, differences in distances of dam to capture site, dam to neonate(s), and neonate to capture site over 48–96 hours post-capture suggested a clear pattern of capture-induced abandonment. None of the birth, capture, neonate, or dam characteristics examined indicated a predisposition to capture-induced abandonment at the study cohort level. However, minimizing capture-induced abandonment through rapid handling of neonates will greatly increase the overall value of field studies that rely on the capture of animals. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

We used time-to-failure curves and multistate mark-recapture models to estimate injury rates, body condition decline, tag loss and survival probabilities associated with two tags commonly used in bats: metallic arm bands and steel ball chain collars. We monitored two colonies of Carollia perspicillata at União Biological Reserve, southeastern Brazil, from 2013 to 2019. Every other month, we marked individuals with arm bands, collars or both. Collars did not cause noticeable injuries, but were lost at a higher rate than arm bands (1.5–2.5 times). The arm band-related injury probability between captures was {\textasciitilde} 0.2, and after 17 months half the marked animals developed injuries. Animals marked as juveniles were less likely to get injured than adults. Injuries were associated with a lower body condition in females. Body condition was positively associated with apparent survival; however, a direct effect of arm band injuries on survival estimates was not observed. The tag loss rates caused a negative bias in survival estimates. Mark-recapture studies should evaluate the efficacy of the marking technique, accounting for potential animal injury, tag loss, and bias in parameter estimation. Marking individuals should be limited to studies that monitor species with high recapture probability, using the least harmful tags possible, and balancing the burden to the animals with the potential to generate knowledge.},

	abstract = {Capture and handling are essential methods for many studies of wild animals but can induce several harmful effects on individuals being studied. The relationship between physiological and behavioral responses in individuals exposed to these effects is not well known. We measured the blood level of muscle enzymes, aspartate aminotrasnsferase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK), indicating muscle damage in hand-reared short-tailed albatross (Phoebastoria albatrus) chicks before and after prolonged restraint for transmitter attachment beyond the usual feeding. We analyzed the relationships between enzyme levels and albatross pre-and post-fledging behaviors. Prolonged restraint for transmitter attachment elevated the blood levels of AST and CK in chicks. In chicks with higher levels of these enzymes, fledging date was earlier and the period to sustained flight after fledging was longer. These results indicated that prolonged handling for transmitter attachment on pre-fledging albatross chicks caused moderate muscle damage and behavioral changes before and after fledging. Although immediate post-fledging survival (the first 2 weeks at sea) did not appear to be affected, whether longer-term survival may be influenced is unknown. Reducing handling time for albatross chicks is important to reduce muscle damage and behavioral consequences.},

	abstract = {Individual identification is required for long-term investigations that examine population-level changes in survival or abundance, and mechanisms associated with these changes in wild populations. Such identification generally requires the application of a unique mark, or the documentation of characteristics distinctive to each individual animal. To minimize impacts to often declining populations, scientific and ethical concerns encourage marking strategies that minimize handling time (i.e., stress) for captured individuals. We examined the relative efficacy of passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagging and photo-identification to identify individual Boreal toads (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) in field and indoor settings. We evaluated whether initial handling time was influenced by identification method (PIT-tag or photo-identification) or environment (field or indoor) and assessed the applicability of each method in long-term monitoring programs. Initial handling time was higher for PIT-tagging than photo-identification and higher in the field than in an indoor environment; however, handling time for previously PIT-tagged individuals was greatly reduced such that photo-identification led to {\textgreater} 5.5 times more handling time than PIT-tagging over the course of a toad's lifetime. Investigators must determine the trade-off between initial and subsequent handling times to minimize the expected (mean) cumulative handling time for an individual over the course of a study. Cumulative handling time is a function of the study design and the species’ survival and detection probabilities. We developed a Shiny Application to allow investigators to determine the identification method that minimizes handling time for their own study system.},

As such, little brown bats are the focus of monitoring and research initiatives that often include capturing and handling free-ranging individuals. We examined the stress response of 198 adult female little brown bats after being captured from three bat houses, during the summer. Our objective was to inform best practices to researchers capturing and handling bats in the wild. We compared the stress response among bats held for \&lt;3 min (baseline), 15–30 min, or \&gt;30 min, and then among bats held alone or in a group with conspecifics. We measured the levels of plasma total and free cortisol, maximum corticosteroid binding capacity (MCBC), and blood glucose. Relative to baseline, total and free cortisol levels were significantly higher in bats held for 15–30 min and higher still in those held for \&gt; 30 min. Blood glucose levels were elevated after \&gt;30 min of holding. MCBC levels showed no differences among holding times. We detected a weak effect of social holding condition, with solitary-held bats having lower total cortisol levels than group-held bats, but MCBC, free cortisol, and blood glucose levels showed no effect of social holding condition. Our findings demonstrate that capture time should be minimized and suggest that little brown bats should be handled and released within 30 min of capture as means of reducing stress. Further, solitary holding did not appear to increase stress measures, which supports holding bats individually after capture, instead of in groups, to reduce risk of pathogen and parasite transmission.},

Such invasive treatment can alter behavior, which may bias results or invalidate assumptions regarding representative behaviors. To assess the impacts of handling on mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), a focal species for research in North America, we investigated pre- and post-recapture movements of collared individuals, and compared them to deer that were not recaptured (controls). We compared pre- and post-recapture movement rates (m/hr) and 24-hour straight-line displacement among recaptured and control deer. In addition, we examined the time it took recaptured deer to return to their pre-recapture home range. Both daily straight-line displacement and movement rate were marginally elevated relative to monthly averages for 24 hours following recapture, with non-significant elevation continuing for up to 7 days. Comparing movements averaged over 30 days before and after recapture, we found no differences in displacement, but movement rates demonstrated seasonal effects, with faster movements post- relative to pre-recapture in March and slower movements post- relative to pre-recapture in December. Relative to control deer movements, recaptured deer movement rates in March were higher immediately after recapture and lower in the second and third weeks following recapture. The median time to return to the pre-recapture home range was 13 hours, with 71\% of deer returning in the first day, and 91\% returning within 4 days. These results indicate a short period of elevated movements following recaptures, likely due to the deer returning to their home ranges, followed by weaker but non-significant depression of movements for up to 3 weeks. Censoring of the first day of data post-capture from analyses is strongly supported, and removing additional days until the individual returns to its home range will control for the majority of impacts from capture. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

In this study, we specifically investigated the effects of repeated nest visits, capture, and handling on offspring survival and several complementary offspring phenotypic traits in the Snow Petrel (Pagodroma nivea) chicks after thermal emancipation. We did not find any significant effect of our disturbance protocol on the morphology (body size, body mass, body condition), the physiology (breath rate, stress-induced corticosterone levels) and the behaviour (defense behaviour) of developing Snow Petrels. This specific disturbance protocol did not have any significant effect on chick survival, but there was a non-significant trend towards a lower survival for the disturbed group (p = 0.1006), which showed an especially high mortality during a period of repeated snow storms. To conclude, investigator disturbance seems to have little effect on Snow Petrel chicks after thermal emancipation, but to remain cautious, we recommend to avoid capture and handling of Snow Petrel chicks during or soon after inclement weather.},

Three species of Old World bats (Pteropus vampyrus, P. Hypomelanus, and Rousettus aegyptiacus) had plasma levels of glucose that were within the normal mammalian range (80–100 mg/dl), with no difference between males and females. All animals had detectable levels of one or both of the major glucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone) found in mammals. Steroid levels were highest in P. hypomelanus (cortisol: 1,269 ± 207 ng/ml; corticosterone; 590 ± 154 ng/ml) and lowest in R. aegyptiacus (corticosterone: 36 ± 4 ng/ml; cortisol not determined). Diurnal changes in these steroids and the effects of handling and restraint stress were further investigated in P. hypomelanus. Experimental animals were captured in their roost quarters, bled once by venupuncture within 3 min, placed singly into a small holding chamber for 50–60 min, and bled again. This procedure was performed at four different times over the course of 24 h with different groups of animals. Glucose was at a minimum just before and a maximum just after the period of food presentation. Cortisol levels remained relatively constant throughout the day‐roosting period and significantly declined to their lowest level in the period following food presentation. As expected, the effects of handling and isolation caused a significant increase in both plasma cortisol and glucose levels. When individual P. hypomelanus were subjected to 3 h restraint stress in small plastic wire‐mesh restraining devices, cortisol levels rose approximately 800\% by 2 h, with the first significant increase at 20 min. Thus, effects of sampling time (time of day) on plasma levels of cortisol and glucose should be considered when designing field and laboratory studies in which hormones and other blood borne parameters are being measured. Handling and bleeding times that exceeded 3 min were associated with elevated plasma levels of cortisol and glucose above resting (unstressed) levels, suggesting that field and laboratory protocols should be designed to reduce or eliminate this problem. Finally, the exceptionally high levels of plasma corticoids in P. hypomelanus, and to a lesser extent in P. vampyrus, place these bats among the highest known circulating adrenal steroid levels of all mammals. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Both GC hormones, cortisol and corticosterone, were detected, with cortisol accounting for an average of {\textasciitilde}95\% of total circulating GCs. Samples collected at the dusk emergence and after the first return from feeding showed significant seasonal differences across the active period (early pregnancy, mid-to-late pregnancy, lactation [and comparable mid-summer times for males], and pre-hibernation) within and between each sex. Elevated baseline values were found in mid-to-late pregnancy females at emergence, and in both males and females at the swarming site compared to other groups. Female GC values during mid-to-late pregnancy and during the pre-hibernation period were greater than those for males. Significantly higher GC levels following 15min of restraint were exhibited by all animals in the summer and prior to hibernation. There was little variation between groups or sexes in the total GC levels reached following restraint. Taken together, these results suggest that: (1) GCs may be involved in the increased feeding and/or fat deposition characteristic of pregnancy and the pre-hibernation period, (2) GCs may be related to mating and to the generally increased levels of activity that occur during the pre-hibernation period, and (3) regardless of sex or reproductive condition, all animals maximally respond to restraint stress. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We measured blood serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), and myoglobin to assess muscle injury in association with different methods of capture. Serum concentrations of AST and CK were above normal in a higher proportion of captures by leghold snare (64\% of 119 grizzly bear captures and 66\% of 165 black bear captures) than capture by helicopter darting (18\% of 87 grizzly bear captures) or by barrel trap (14\% of 7 grizzly bear captures and 29\% of 7 black bear captures). Extreme AST values ({\textgreater}5 times upper reference limit) in 7 (6\%) grizzly bears and 29 (18\%) black bears captured by leghold snare were consistent with the occurrence of exertional (capture) myopathy. We calculated daily movement rates for 91 radiocollared grizzly bears and 128 radiocollared black bears to determine if our activities affected their mobility during a 100-day period after capture. In both species, movement rates decreased below mean normal rate immediately after capture (grizzly bears: X̄ = 57\% of normal, 95\% confidence interval = 45-74\%; black bears: 77\%, 64-88\%) and then returned to normal in 3-6 weeks (grizzly bears: 28 days, 20-37 days; black bears: 36 days, 19-53 days). We examined the effect of repeated captures on age-related changes in body condition of 127 grizzly bears and 207 black bears and found in both species that age-specific body condition of bears captured ≥2 times (42 grizzly bears and 98 black bears) tended to be poorer than that of bears captured once only (85 grizzly bears and 109 black bears), with the magnitude of effect directly proportional to number of times captured and the effect more evident with age. Importantly, the condition of bears did not affect their probability of capture or recapture.

	abstract = {Social network analysis is increasingly applied to understand animal groups. However, it is rarely feasible to observe every interaction among all individuals in natural populations. Studies have assessed how missing information affects estimates of individual network positions, but less attention has been paid to metrics that characterize overall network structure such as modularity, clustering coefficient, and density. In cases such as groups displaying fission-fusion dynamics, where subgroups break apart and rejoin in changing conformations, missing information may affect estimates of global network structure differently than in groups with distinctly separated communities due to the influence single individuals can have on the connectivity of the network. Using a bat maternity group showing fission-fusion dynamics, we quantify the effect of missing data on global network measures including community detection. In our system, estimating the number of communities was less reliable than detecting community structure. Further, reliably assorting individual bats into communities required fewer individuals and fewer observations per individual than to estimate the number of communities. Specifically, our metrics of global network structure (i.e., graph density, clustering coefficient, Rcom) approached the 'real' values with increasing numbers of observations per individual and, as the number of individuals included increased, the variance in these estimates decreased. Similar to previous studies, we recommend that more observations per individual should be prioritized over including more individuals when resources are limited. We recommend caution when making conclusions about animal social networks when a substantial number of individuals or observations are missing, and when possible, suggest subsampling large datasets to observe how estimates are influenced by sampling intensity. Our study serves as an example of the reliability, or lack thereof, of global network measures with missing information, but further work is needed to determine how estimates will vary with different data collection methods, network structures, and sampling periods.},

Animal positions provide the elemental unit of movement paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists in their search for a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness.

	abstract = {The white-striped free-tailed bat (Tadarida australis) is a common species of insectivorous bat found in mainland Australia. Despite its abundance, very little is known about its roosting ecology. I used radiotelemetry collected during 3 seasons to examine roost fidelity and roosting associations of a summer roosting group. Bats were trapped at a large communal roost in subtropical urban Brisbane, Australia. A total of 132 radiotracking days and nights provided 509 bat-days of data, with each bat being tracked for 26.9 days ± 28.6 SD. Seventeen new roost trees were found, scattered throughout an area of {\textgreater}200 km2. Roost cavities were located inside eucalypt trees {\textgreater}83 cm diameter at breast height. Tagged T. australis switched roosts every 10.6 ± 7.9 days on average and spent most of their time in day-roosts with smaller roosting groups despite being 1 st caught at the communal roost. I quantified associations between pairs of tagged bats using a pairwise sharing index. The consistent negative values of the pairwise sharing index I calculated indicated that members associated with roost-mates less often than predicted by chance. However, bats typically associated at night at the communal roost, even when they did not occupy it during the day. For every day-visit recorded per bat at the communal roost, each bat visited the same roost twice at night on average. This suggests that nocturnal movements of individuals should be included in assessments of associations between individuals. I postulate that this species employs a fission-fusion pattern based on individual movements to and from 1 communal site. I also argue that the roost network of 1 communal roost and many satellite roosts may be regarded as a single interconnected unit. © 2007 American Society of Mammalogists.},

Its extensive use by individuals to locate food patches has been documented in a number of species, and various mechanisms of discovery have been identified. However, less is known about whether individuals differ in their access to, and use of, social information to find food. We measured the social network of a wild population of three sympatric tit species (family Paridae) and then recorded individual discovery of novel food patches. By using recently developed methods for network-based diffusion analysis, we show that order of arrival at new food patches was predicted by social associations. Models based only on group searching did not explain this relationship. Furthermore, network position was correlated with likelihood of patch discovery, with central individuals more likely to locate and use novel foraging patches than those with limited social connections. These results demonstrate the utility of social network analysis as a method to investigate social information use, and suggest that the greater probability of receiving social information about new foraging patches confers a benefit on more socially connected individuals.},

	abstract = {Social bonds, maintained by mutual investments of time and energy, have greatly influenced the evolution of social cognition and cooperation in many species [e.g., 1–8]. However, there are two pitfalls regarding “social bonds” as an explanation for social structure and cooperation [1, 9–11]. First, studies often incorrectly assume that frequent association implies partner fidelity based on mutual social preference, but even seemingly complex nonrandom interaction networks can emerge solely from habitat or spatial structure [12–16]. Second, the false appearance of partner fidelity can result from stable options in the “partner market” [1, 9–11, 17]. For instance, individuals might preferentially groom the same partner, even if the decision depends entirely on the immediate costs and benefits rather than relationship history. Given these issues, a key challenge has been testing the extent to which social structure is driven by the intrinsic relationship history versus the extrinsic physical and social environment. If stable bonds exist, they should persist even if the individuals are moved to a dramatically different physical and social environment. We tested this prediction by tracking social relationships among common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) moved from the lab to the wild. We show that allogrooming and food sharing among female vampire bats induced in captivity over 22 months predicted their assortativity and association rates when we subsequently tracked them in the wild with custom-made high-resolution proximity sensors. The persistence of many relationships across different physical and social environments suggests that social structure is caused by both extrinsic constraints and intrinsic partner fidelity.},

However, research on social strategies has largely ignored solitary animals, in which we assume that rare interactions are explained by courtship or territoriality or, in special circumstances, resource distributions or kinship. We used directed network analysis of conspecific tolerance at food sources to provide evidence that a solitary carnivore, the puma (Puma concolor), exhibited adaptive social strategies similar to more social animals. Every puma in our analysis participated in the network, which featured densely connected communities delineated by territorial males. Territorial males also structured social interactions among pumas. Contrary to expectations, conspecific tolerance was best characterized by direct reciprocity, establishing a fitness benefit to individuals that participated in social behaviors. However, reciprocity operated on a longer time scale than in gregarious species. Tolerance was also explained by hierarchical reciprocity, which we defined as network triangles in which one puma (generally male) received tolerance from two others (generally females) that also tolerated each other. Hierarchical reciprocity suggested that males might be cheating females; nevertheless, we suspect that males and females used different fitness currencies. For example, females may have benefited from tolerating males through the maintenance of social niches that support breeding opportunities. Our work contributes evidence of adaptive social strategies in a solitary carnivore and support for the applicability of theories of social behavior across taxa, including solitary species in which they are rarely tested.},

This low-budget ‘TickTag’ (currently 32 USD) allows scientists to scale-up studies while becoming a ‘wearable’ for larger animals and simultaneously enabling high-definition studies on small animals. Tests on two different species (domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris and greater mouse-eared bats, Myotis myotis) showed that our combination of optimised hardware design and software-based recording strategies increases the number of achievable GPS fixes per g device mass compared to existing micro-sized solutions.

	abstract = {Bioacoustics is one of the most popular methods in bat research. Bat species are identifiable through their echolocation call features (e.g. peak frequency, duration, bandwidth) but the amounts of recordings to process generally require the help of machine learning algorithms. Yet, classifiers are only developed in some areas of the world and it may take dozens of years before they are available everywhere because reference calls are still lacking for numerous species. Our goal was to develop a universal classifier that would classify bat sonotypes according to call shape and peak frequency. To achieve this, we first defined eight sonotype categories that cover all bat echolocation shapes worldwide. We then trained a classifier using random forest decision trees with a database of 1,154,835 labelled sound events containing bat and non-bat sounds from four continents. After classification, we developed a process to group detected sound events according to the probability scores of their predicted sonotype category and their peak frequency. We then tested the performance of our classifier on a different set of recordings originating from five continents. Depending on the bat sonotype tested, the performance (area under ROC curve) of our classifier ranged between 0.77 and 0.99 for low-quality calls (SNR {\textless} 25 dB). Performance ranged between 0.89 and 1 for middle- or high-quality calls (SNR ≥ 25 dB). The performance for bat feeding buzz classification ranged between 0.93 and 0.98 depending on the SNR. The classifier was not developed to classify bat social calls; the majority of them were classified as a bat sonotype. The classifier is an open data format and can be used by anyone to study bats around the world. It can be used to spot acoustically described species but for which a classifier was not developed, and even to detect species that were not acoustically described yet. The grouping of sound events according to call sonotype and peak frequency may be used to describe bat communities and compare the composition of acoustic niches across time and space. This allows the monitoring of bats and the assessment of bat conservation issues in any region of the world.},

However, when occlusion occurs in nonlinear motion scenarios, many existing methods often fail to continuously track multiple moving objects of interest. In this paper we propose an effective approach for detection and tracking of multiple moving objects with occlusion. Moving targets are initially detected using a simple yet efficient block matching technique, providing rough location information for multiple object tracking. More accurate location information is then estimated for each moving object by a nonlinear tracking algorithm. Considering the ambiguity caused by the occlusion among multiple moving objects, we apply an unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) technique for reliable object detection and tracking. Different from conventional Kalman filtering (KF), which cannot achieve the optimal estimation in nonlinear tracking scenarios, UKF can be used to track both linear and nonlinear motions due to the unscented transform. Further, it estimates the velocity information for each object to assist to the object detection algorithm, effectively delineating multiple moving objects of occlusion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can correctly detect and track multiple moving objects with nonlinear motion patterns and occlusions.},

	abstract = {Bats are highly social animals, and the interactions between individuals are likely to be important to their ecology and conservation. Social structures are affected by the physical environment (spatial factors), as well as varying over time and seasons (temporal factors). Compared with many other taxa, individual bats are capable of moving large distances, so experience a range of spatial locations. They have long life spans, providing opportunities to interact with others over a long period, and are often highly gregarious. Using a long-term data set, we examined the social behaviour, along with spatial and temporal influences, of greater horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, during hibernation using social network approaches. Across 17 years, 2808 individuals were monitored, yielding a total of 5952 records at 21 roost locations. We investigated how individuals’ life history traits (sex, age and breeding status of females) and the frequency of observation affected social associations and identified factors that influenced the movement of individuals between locations. Older and male animals were significantly more central in the social network, and adult males may act as a link between socially separate individuals within the society. The social network had high nonrandom dyadic structuring, with assortment by age stronger in females than males, and this was likely to be influenced by spatiotemporal factors. In general, higher weighted betweenness scores were recorded in a noncore hibernaculum, suggesting that these sites, despite low numbers of bats being present, may act as locations to connect less-connected individuals, as well as communities. Finally, movements between hibernacula were only associated with the frequency of observation rather than any life history trait. These results illustrate the interconnectivity across sites, stressing the need for appropriate cross-jurisdiction species management plans to be created for species that utilize and move between multiple sites within the landscape.},

	abstract = {In some group-living animals, societies are far from being static but are instead dynamic entities encompassing multiple scales of organization. We found that maternity colonies of giant noctule bats, Nyctalus lasiopterus, form fission-fusion societies, where group composition in single tree roosts changes on a daily basis but social cohesion in the larger group is preserved. The population inside a small city park was comprised of three distinct but cryptic social groups coexisting in close proximity. Each social group used a distinct roosting area, but some overlap existed in the boundaries between them. Social groups were stable at least in the mid term because adult females were loyal to roosting areas and young females returned to their natal social groups in successive years. Our results suggest that distinct social groups with separate roosting areas may have existed for at least 14 years. The findings described support the hypothesis that roost-switching behaviour in forest bats permits the maintenance of social bonds between colony members and enhances knowledge about a colony's roosting resources. Fission-fusion societies in forest bats might have evolved as a mechanism to cope with changing conditions in the environment by restructuring subgroups or adjusting subgroup size, to maximize the amount of information that can be transferred between colony members, or as a consequence of territory inheritance by philopatric female offspring. Other factors such as resource competition or kin selection could limit the size and composition of fission-fusion societies and promote strong social structuring within populations. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

	abstract = {When selecting feeding, hiding, or resting areas, animals face multiple decisions with different fitness consequences. To maximize efficiency, individuals can either collect personal information, or use information gathered and transmitted by other individuals (social information). Within group living species, organisms often specialize in either generating social information or using information gathered by other groups members. That is the case of the Spix’s disk-winged bat, Thyroptera tricolor. This species uses contact calls during roost finding. Social groups are composed by a mix of vocal and non-vocal individuals and those vocal roles appear to be consistent over time. Moreover, their vocal behavior can predict roost finding in natural settings, suggesting that vocal individuals are capable of generating social information that can be used by other group members. To date, however, we do not know if when presented with social information (contact calls) during roost finding, vocal individuals will make more or less use of these cues, compared to non-vocal individuals. To answer this question, we broadcast contact calls from a roost inside a flight cage to test whether vocal individuals could find a potential roost faster than non-vocal individuals when they encounter sounds that signal the presence of a roost site. Our results suggest that non-vocal individuals select roost sites based primarily on social information, whereas vocal individuals do not rely heavily on social information when deciding where to roost. This study provides the first link between vocal behavior and the use of social information during the search for roosting resources in bats. Incorporating ideas of social roles, and how individuals decide when and where to move based on the use of social information, may shed some light on these and other outstanding questions about the social lives of bats.},

	abstract = {Resources that draw individuals to a specific location may result in the formation of groups and development of individual social preferences. Simultaneously considering both ecological and social factors can therefore reveal underlying mechanisms of group formation and organization. Females of some temperate bat species roost in groups during the spring and summer months within which they give birth to and nurse their pups. Females switch roosts frequently, but the factors that influence roost switching remain poorly understood. To characterize the structure of a bat maternity group and gather evidence for the role of social preference in shaping this structure, we used roost co-occurrence data from little brown myotis, Myotis lucifugus, implanted with passive integrated transponder tags and roost boxes monitored with passive readers in Salmonier Nature Park, Newfoundland, Canada. By developing informed null models, we more directly investigate hypotheses that may explain why bats roost together. Although our results suggest that association patterns of maternity groups can largely be explained by similar interindividual patterns in bats' roosting frequencies within a given roost box (roost fidelity), other factors are likely to contribute to the observed structure. We thus provide support for the potential influence of roost and social preferences in shaping maternity group structure.},

With these measures we can also solve the inverse problem: given the network of ties among organization members, how can we form a team that is maximally central? The measures are illustrated using two classic network data sets.

New records show the eastern pipistrelle confined to the Fundy coast of New Brunswick, but over-wintering in both natural caves and an abandoned graphite mine. In New Brunswick, where they have been recorded hibernating with congregations of Myotis species, eastern pipistrelles comprised less than 1.5\% of the bats present. Pipistrelle echolocation sequences that are the first reports for the species outside winter roosting habitat in New Brunswick indicate a strong preference for feeding over water.

Quantitative threat assessment often requires monitoring programs that provide reliable data over relevant spatial and temporal scales, yet such programs can be difficult to justify until there is an apparent stressor. Leveraging efforts of wildlife management agencies to record winter counts of hibernating bats, we collated data for 5 species from over 200 sites across 27 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces from 1995 to 2018 to determine the impact of white-nose syndrome (WNS), a deadly disease of hibernating bats. We estimated declines of winter counts of bat colonies at sites where the invasive fungus that causes WNS (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) had been detected to assess the threat impact of WNS. Three species undergoing species status assessment by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Myotis septentrionalis, Myotis lucifugus, and Perimyotis subflavus) declined by more than 90\%, which warrants classifying the severity of the WNS threat as extreme based on criteria used by NatureServe. The scope of the WNS threat as defined by NatureServe criteria was large (36\% of Myotis lucifugus range) to pervasive (79\% of Myotis septentrionalis range) for these species. Declines for 2 other species (Myotis sodalis and Eptesicus fuscus) were less severe but still qualified as moderate to serious based on NatureServe criteria. Data-sharing across jurisdictions provided a comprehensive evaluation of scope and severity of the threat of WNS and indicated regional differences that can inform response efforts at international, national, and state or provincial jurisdictions. We assessed the threat impact of an emerging infectious disease by uniting monitoring efforts across jurisdictional boundaries and demonstrated the importance of coordinated monitoring programs, such as the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat), for data-driven conservation assessments and planning.},

Estimates of bat populations prior to the outbreak of white-nose syndrome are presented for 2009-2011 for the most significant bat hibernacula known in New Brunswick. At one of these sites we recorded a major mortality event from white-nose syndrome, the first in the Maritime provinces, late in the winter of 2011. Winter surveys of hibernating bats suggest that a minimum of 7 000 bats overwintered in these hibernacula prior to the outbreak of white-nose syndrome in New Brunswick. The majority of hibernating bats in New Brunswick caves are Myotis lucifugus (Little Brown Myotis) and M. septentrionalis (Northern Myotis), with low numbers of Perimyotis subflavus (Tricolored Bat). The New Brunswick hibernacula that support the greatest numbers of overwintering bats have little temperature variation, winter dark zone temperatures averaging 4-5°C, and minimum dark zone temperatures dropping to no lower than 3.1°C. New Brunswick caves with these temperature patterns characteristically have ≥140 m of main passage and lack both running water and multiple entrances. Few cave sites in the province meet these criteria, and the known winter bat population appears to be smaller than the summer population. Many bats present during the summer in New Brunswick either hibernate in unknown locations in the province or migrate out of the province to locate suitable hibernacula. Such movements may have hastened the arrival of white-nose syndrome in New Brunswick.},

To examine the impact of landscape structure on the distribution of forest-dwelling bats, we examined the effects of these factors on the distribution and activity patterns of tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) in Nova Scotia, Canada. In Nova Scotia maternity colonies of the tri-colored bat use clumps of Usnea spp. lichen for roosting, typically in mature spruce trees. In 2005 and 2006, we used Anabats to assess tri-colored bat activity at 90 river sites in southwest Nova Scotia. The results of echolocation monitoring indicate that the tri-colored bat occurs within a minimum area of 10,020km2. The best landscape predictor of the magnitude of tri-colored activity was non-forested land area within commuting distance of survey sites, suggesting that tri-colored bats were less active in landscapes where forests are cleared for agriculture, settlements and timber production. Therefore, this is an example of a forest-associated bat that seems to be negatively impacted by landscape practices that reduce the spatial extent of forests. © 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.},

These bats live in highly dynamic fission–fusion societies that share multiple roosts in a common home range. The key behavioural component associated with complex and non-centralized decision-making processes in roost switching is swarming around potential locations in order to recruit members to the new roost. To understand roost switching dynamics of bat groups in their natural environment, we employed a computational model, the SkyBat, which is based on swarm algorithm, to model this process. In a simulated environment of this agent-based model, we replicated natural fission–fusion dynamics of the Leisler’s bat, Nyctalus leisleri, groups according to predefined species and habitat parameters. Spatiotemporal patterns of swarming activity of agents were similar to bats. The number of simulated groups formed prior to sunrise, the mean number of individuals in groups and the roost height did not differ significantly from data on a local population of bats collected in the field. Thus, the swarm algorithm gave a basic framework of roost-switching, suggesting possible applications in the study of bat behaviour in rapidly changing environments as well as in the field of computer science.},

An important challenge to collaborative monitoring is motivating local engagement with enough buy-in from stakeholders while providing adequate top-down direction for scientific rigor, quality control, and coordination. Collaborative monitoring must reconcile this inherent tension between top-down control and bottom-up engagement. Highly mobile and cryptic taxa, such as bats, present a particularly acute challenge. Given their scale of movement, complex life histories, and rapidly expanding threats, understanding population trends of bats requires coordinated broad-scale collaborative monitoring. The North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) reconciles top-down, bottom-up tension with a hierarchical master sample survey design, integrated data analysis, dynamic data curation, regional monitoring hubs, and knowledge delivery through web-based infrastructure.

However, for individuals occupying spatially limited structures, such as tree cavities, group formation may influence—and be influenced by—the range of structures available for use. This may be especially true of bats, which often form maternity groups that regularly change in size. We examined colonies of tree-roosting little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus (LeConte, 1831)) in northern Alberta to address two questions: (1) is group size associated with patterns of roost use, in particular the use of large-diameter trees, and (2) does group size change during reproduction and correspond to changes in roost use? We located roosts over 2 years using radiotelemetry and conducted exit counts at a subset of these roosts. Larger diameter trees had larger and more variable group sizes. Roost-tree diameter peaked near the start of parturition, the time when bats formed the largest groups. We suggest that large groups are especially beneficial at this time due to the thermoregulatory benefits to small, unfurred pups. Our results indicate that roost use and group size are interrelated and that large-diameter trees may be especially beneficial by supporting a wider range of group sizes.},

Swarming behaviour was not influenced by body condition and reproductive status alone, although the data indicate that males of a lower body conditions do return more often, and swarm for longer durations. Roosts used during the swarming season had a predominantly southwestern orientation unlike summer roosts, but were most often found in mid-late decay stage trees of conifer-dominated forests.

	abstract = {Characterizing movement dynamics and spatial aspects of gene flow within a species permits inference on population structuring. As patterns of structuring are products of historical and current demographics and gene flow, assessment of structure through time can yield an understanding of evolutionary dynamics acting on populations that are necessary to inform management. Recent dramatic population declines in hibernating bats in eastern North America from white-nose syndrome have prompted the need for information on movement dynamics for multiple bat species. We characterized population genetic structure of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, at swarming sites in southeastern Canada using 9 nuclear microsatellites and a 292-bp region of the mitochondrial genome. Analyses of FST, ΦST, and Bayesian clustering (STRUCTURE) found weak levels of genetic structure among swarming sites for the nuclear and mitochondrial genome (Global FST = 0.001, P {\textless} 0.05, Global ΦST = 0.045, P {\textless} 0.01, STRUCTURE K = 1) suggesting high contemporary gene flow. Hierarchical AMOVA also suggests little structuring at a regional (provincial) level. Metrics of nuclear genetic structure were not found to differ between males and females suggesting weak asymmetries in gene flow between the sexes. However, a greater degree of mitochondrial structuring does support male-biased dispersal long term. Demographic analyses were consistent with past population growth and suggest a population expansion occurred from approximately 1250 to 12,500 BP, following Pleistocene deglaciation in the region. Our study suggests high gene flow and thus a high degree of connectivity among bats that visit swarming sites whereby mainland areas of the region may be best considered as one large gene pool for management and conservation.},

	abstract = {For bats that are year-round residents of temperate areas, underground openings such as caves and abandoned mines are critical resources in winter as hibernacula, and in autumn for swarming behaviours (mating, socialization, etc.). Like many parts of the world, Nova Scotia, Canada, has many underground openings that have not been surveyed for bats. The feature(s) that affect the suitability of these sites for hibernation or swarming is not known. As such, it is not possible to predict which ones are used by local bats (Myotis lucifugus, Myotis septentrionalis and Perimyotis subflavus). Because it was not safe to enter the sites to conduct hibernation counts, our goal was to relate bat activity at the entrance of underground openings during swarming to quantifiable external metrics and to pre-existing data on internal site characteristics. Specifically, our objectives were to 1) identify abandoned mines and caves that are used by bats for swarming and 2) quantitatively characterize factors which best differentiate between underground openings that are used for swarming, and those that are not. We assumed that sites used by bats for swarming were likely also used for hibernation. Acoustic and/or trapping surveys were conducted at 17 abandoned mines and eight caves in Nova Scotia, five of which were previously known to be hibernacula. Results suggest that at least 12 of the 25 sites were swarming sites (including seven newly identified sites). Logistic regression analysis of nine a priori selected models indicated that internal chamber length was the best predictor of swarming activity. Two external variables, degree of shelter at entrance and total length of rivers in landscape, were also important predictors. These variables have the potential to be used as indicators to identify swarming sites at other sites in eastern North America. The swarming sites identified in Nova Scotia should be targeted for monitoring in light of the devastating impacts that white-nose syndrome is having on North American bats. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.},

	abstract = {An apparently disjunct population of tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) exists in southwest Nova Scotia. During the summers of 2003-2004 and 2007-2008 we trapped bats in mist nets set at a bridge over the Mersey River in Kejimkujik National Park. In total we captured 42 tricolored bats (41 female and 1 male) and fitted 32 females and the single male with radio transmitters and tracked them to their roost sites daily. Characteristics of roost sites were compared to those of randomly selected, potentially available roost sites using an a priori-selected candidate set of models and ranked using AICc for model selection. In total we found 99 unique roost trees in 9 spatially distinct (8 female, 1 male) roosting areas. On average, bats spent 2.5 d in a roost tree. While conspecifics from other parts of the species' range typically roost in tree foliage, maternity colonies of tricolored bats in Nova Scotia roosted exclusively in Usnea trichodea lichen, typically in conifers (of which 91\% were spruce; Picea spp.) that were on average 212 m from water. Only 4\% of the 300 random trees from the landscape contained Usnea trichodea. These trees were a mixture of softwood and hardwood (58\% and 42\%, respectively) and were, on average, 550 m from water. These findings represent an apparently unique relationship between lichens and bats that likely impacts many aspects of the species biology, including distribution, social structure, and parasite prevalence. © 2010 BioOne All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although only 2 bat species are common in the Greater Fundy National Park Ecosystem of New Brunswick, Canada, 4 distinct groups occur in terms of roost-site selection due to sexual segregation. We found that female northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) roosted alone or as part of maternity colonies in mature, shade-tolerant deciduous stands. A roost site was 24 times more likely to be in a shade-tolerant deciduous tree than a coniferous tree, and trees in the mid-decay classes were 5.2 times more likely to be used than live or recently dead trees. Male northern long-eared bats roosted alone in coniferous stands or conifer-dominated mixedwood stands, and they selected roost trees that were in the mid-decay stages. Trees in mid-decay stages were selected more than twice as often as trees at the early or late stages of decay. For every 10\% increase in the proportion of coniferous trees in the plot, the chances of a male northern long-eared bat roosting in the plot increased 1.5 times. Female little brown bats (M. lucifugus) in our study area were transients. Male little brown bats primarily roosted alone in coniferous stands, or conifer-dominated mixedwood stands. Their selection of roost sites was highly dependent on the number of snags in the vicinity. For every increase of 5 snags in a 0.1-ha plot, the odds of use for male little brown bats on that site increased by 2.5 times. The long-term availability of roost sites for males of both species in our study area may be linked to spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) epizootics, which is the major mortality factor for coniferous species in the region. Female northern long-eared bat roosts probably are more consistantly available because suitable sites are created by continuously occurring, individual-tree stressors in mature shade-tolerant forests.},

	abstract = {Background: Bridges, brokers and boundary spanners facilitate transactions and the flow of information between people or groups who either have no physical or cognitive access to one another, or alternatively, who have no basis on which to trust each other. The health care sector is a context that is rich in isolated clusters, such as silos and professional "tribes," in need of connectivity. It is a key challenge in health service management to understand, analyse and exploit the role of key agents who have the capacity to connect disparate groupings in larger systems. Methods. The empirical, peer reviewed, network theory literature on brokerage roles was reviewed for the years 1994 to 2011 following PRISMA guidelines. Results: The 24 articles that made up the final literature set were from a wide range of settings and contexts not just healthcare. Methods of data collection, analysis, and the ways in which brokers were identified varied greatly. We found four main themes addressed in the literature: identifying brokers and brokerage opportunities, generation and integration of innovation, knowledge brokerage, and trust. The benefits as well as the costs of brokerage roles were examined. Conclusions: Collaborative networks by definition, seek to bring disparate groups together so that they can work effectively and synergistically together. Brokers can support the controlled transfer of specialised knowledge between groups, increase cooperation by liaising with people from both sides of the gap, and improve efficiency by introducing "good ideas" from one isolated setting into another.There are significant costs to brokerage. Densely linked networks are more efficient at diffusing information to all their members when compared to sparsely linked groups. This means that while a bridge across a structural hole allows information to reach actors that were previously isolated, it is not the most efficient way to transfer information. Brokers who become the holders of, or the gatekeepers to, specialised knowledge or resources can become overwhelmed by the role and so need support in order to function optimally. © 2013 Long et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving.

I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The between-group brokers are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable.

	abstract = {Lifestyle choices from childhood, such as being physically active, track into adult- hood. A key factor that influences a child’s likelihood of being healthy is their level of social competence. Social Competence (SC) is the interaction between the environment and biologi- cally determined abilities and is shaped by social support systems. An underdeveloped SC in- creases a child’s risk of unhealthy lifestyles as an adult as they believe themselves incapable of adjusting their habits. Children with biologically determined inabilities, such as motor impair- ments, have been demonstrated to have an activity deficit, particularly in sport participation. The relationships between social competence, motor performance, and physical activity are largely unexplored. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role that SC plays as a mediator between Motor Performance (MP) and organized sports participation in preadolescent chil- dren. This sample is 1958 sixth grade children (50.2\% males) taken from the Physical Health Activity Study Team (PHAST) study in Ontario, Canada. Organized sport participation was determined using the Participation Questionnaire, MP was established using the short form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP) and SC was determined through Harter’s Self-Perception Scale. The results indicated that MP and SC are independent predic- tors of sport participation. Children with low MP and low SC were at significantly greater risk of low sport participation (ORmales =2.82; ORfemales =2.41). Children with low MP and high SC (ORmales =1.04; ORfemales =1.41) or high MP and low SC (ORmales =1.12; ORfemales =0.98) revealed no increased risk of low sport participation. SC plays an important role in organized sport participation during childhood and ameliorates the risk of inactivity associated with lower MP. With high SC diminishing the risk of low sport participation from low MP, a child’s risk of low physical fitness may be subsequently reduced and therefore may be an important consideration for activity promotions.},

	abstract = {Many studies of animal personality are completed in the laboratory with animals collected from the wild. However, there is some concern that studies that trap individuals to perform assessments of personality may not collect a representative sample of personality types, as some individuals may be trap-shy. We investigated the relationship between boldness and trappability using males of a species of lizard, the Namibian rock agama, . Agama planiceps, whose boldness could be assessed in the wild prior to trapping. We observed known individuals between nine and 15 times each over several weeks, which revealed that boldness consistently differed across individuals and was not influenced by factors such as body size or environmental variables. Lizards habituated to the behavioural assay, but there was no evidence of plasticity (individual differences) in the rate of habituation. As predicted, bold individuals entered the trap sooner than shy individuals and we had higher success at trapping bold individuals. Using a simple simulation model, we show that such bias leads to underestimates of effect size and reduces the power to detect correlations between behavioural traits (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We suggest that studies that trap animals for laboratory assessments of personality may consistently underrepresent the extent of personality trait variation in the populations that they sample, and recommend that future studies either develop methods for testing personality in the field that control for obvious confounding variables or make every effort to ensure minimum bias when sampling animals for use in a laboratory setting. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Significant yearly variation occurred in both measures. Trap response heterogeneity among sexes did not emerge until the mice were subadults or adults. There was significant yearly variation in proportions of recruits entering traps as juveniles, subadults, or both.

	abstract = {The concept of behavioural syndromes hypothesizes that consistent behaviours across various situations mediate important life history trade-offs, and predicts correlations among behavioural traits. We studied the consistency of behavioural responses across three ecological situations (exploration of an environment altered with a novel object, aggression towards conspecifics, risk taking) in male collared flycatchers. We developed behavioural tests that could be applied in the birds' natural habitat, thus not requiring the capture of animals. Across individuals, we found positive covariation between exploration, aggression and risk taking, but the magnitude of these relationships varied. Variation in behaviour was also related to capture probability. Exploratory and risk-taking individuals were more likely to enter a trap than individuals with averse characteristics. Moreover, with the trapped birds, there was an association between the time needed for successful capture and exploration, and we found stronger correlations between behaviours in comparison with effects calculated from the whole sample of individuals. These patterns were independent of territory quality, male age, condition and breeding experience. Consequently, behavioural responses to different ecosocial challenges are determined by individual-specific characteristics that are manifested in correlative behaviours. Hence, behavioural types may be potential subjects for reproductive and life history adaptations. Our results have important implications for field studies of animals, because they suggest that capturing protocols may not randomly sample the observed population. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Nothing is known of the emerging properties of animal societies, but it would be expected that similar trends would emerge from the topology of animal social networks. Despite its small size (64 individuals), the Doubtful Sound community of bottlenose dolphins has the same characteristics. The connectivity of individuals follows a complex distribution that has a scale-free power-law distribution for large k. In addition, the ability for two individuals to be in contact is unaffected by the random removal of individuals. The removal of individuals with many links to others does affect the length of the 'information' path between two individuals, but, unlike other scale-free networks, it does not fragment the cohesion of the social network. These self-organizing phenomena allow the network to remain united, even in the case of catastrophic death events.},

It explains roles by presuming that persons are members of social positions and hold expectations for their own behaviors and those of other persons. Its vocabulary and concerns are popular among social scientists and practitioners, and role concepts have generated a lot of research. At least five perspectives may be discriminated in recent work within the field: functional, symbolic interactionist, structural, organizational, and cognitive role theory. Much of role research reflects practical concerns and derived concepts, and research on four such concepts is reviewed: consensus, conformity, role conflict, and role taking. Recent developments suggest both centrifugal and integrative forces within the role field. The former reflect differing perspectival commitments of scholars, confusions and disagreements over use of role concepts, and the fact that role theory is used to analyze various forms of social system. The latter reflect the shared, basic concerns of the field and efforts by role theorists to seek a broad version of the field that will accommodate a wide range of interests.},

Here, we investigated whether bats have persistent social preferences by testing whether relationships between dyads in a focal year could be predicted by previous years. We also hypothesized that experience influences social preferences and predicted that an individual’s age would influence its network position, while familiarity with bats of the same cohort would drive persistent social preferences. We quantified roost co-occurrence in little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) in Salmonier Nature Park, Newfoundland, Canada both within and among years. We found that roost co-occurrence patterns of previous years still had predictive value even when accounting for potential roost fidelity. However, we found no evidence that cohort familiarity or age explained any of the variation. Overall, we found long-term patterns of association in this temperate bat species that suggest levels of social complexity akin to other large mammal species.},

We studied yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer, and performed a series of statistical/topological knockouts on observed marmot social networks to investigate how the social roles of individuals from specific age–sex categories (adult/yearling, males/females) contribute to group social structure and to ask whether the loss of different roles has varying structural effects. We focused on five central aspects of overall social structure: density, the global clustering coefficient, reciprocity, global degree centrality and the coefficient of variation of strength. Somewhat surprisingly, given that marmots live in matrilines, our knockout results suggested that males played a key role in shaping networks: yearling males were a key cohesive element and adult males were central players in agonistic networks. Thus, social networks are dynamic and their structure is shaped in the interplay of demographic processes and individual social behaviour.},

Through combining the automated tracking of winter flocks of over 500 wild great tits (Parus major) with removal experiments, we assessed how individuals’ social network positions responded to the loss of their social associates. We found that the extent of flockmate loss that individuals experienced correlated positively with subsequent increases in the number of their social associations, the average strength of their bonds and their overall connectedness within the social network (defined as summed edge weights). Increased social connectivity was not driven by general disturbance or changes in foraging behaviour, but by modifications to fine-scale social network connections in response to losing their associates. Therefore, the reduction in social connectedness expected by individual loss may be mitigated by increases in social associations between remaining individuals. Given that these findings demonstrate rapid adjustment of social network associations in response to the loss of previous social ties, future research should examine the generality of the compensatory adjustment of social relations in ways that maintain the structure of social organization.},

	abstract = {Social groups exist because some individuals within the group accrue a net benefit from sharing space. The profitability of sociality, however, varies with ecological context. As ecological context varies, tension emerges among the costs and benefits of social grouping. Fission–fusion societies are fluid in their group dynamics across spatial and temporal contexts, permitting insights into how context affects whether animals choose to join or depart from a group. We tested four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses driving variation in fission and fusion in caribou, Rangifer tarandus: (1) risky places, (2) environment heterogeneity, (3) activity budget and (4) social familiarity. The risky places hypothesis predicts that animals are unlikely to diffuse when habitats are open and the risk of predation is elevated. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis predicts that fission is more likely in a heterogeneous landscape due to the rising conflicts of interest between group members. The activity budget hypothesis predicts that dyads associate by body size due to similar food passage rates. The social cohesion hypothesis predicts that familiar individuals are less likely to fission. We tested the hypotheses using time-to-event (time before fission) analyses and a linear model that assesses spatial, social and body size relationships among female caribou (N = 22) on Fogo Island, Newfoundland, Canada. Contrary to our prediction for risky places, probability of fission was not influenced by habitat openness. The hypothesis of environmental heterogeneity was partially supported, as caribou remained less cohesive in environments with a higher richness of habitats. No direct evidence emerged to support the activity budget hypothesis. However, it appears that caribou maintain the strongest social bonds among variably sized individuals and that these social bonds do decrease the propensity to split. Collectively, our findings showed that social interactions may depend not only on individual identity and characteristics, but also on the spatial context in which these interactions occur.},

Our approach identifies temporal regions of dense agent activity and links are drawn between individuals based on their co-occurrences across these 'gathering events'.

Such a framework allows us to exploit the wealth of analytical and computational tools of network analysis in settings where the underlying connectivity pattern between interacting agents (commonly termed the adjacency matrix) is not given a priori. We perform experiments on two large-scale datasets (greater than 106 points) of great tit Parus major wild bird foraging records and illustrate the use of this approach by examining the temporal dynamics of pairing behaviour, a process that was previously very hard to observe. We show that established pair bonds are maintained continuously, whereas new pair bonds form at variable times before breeding, but are characterized by a rapid development of network proximity. The method proposed here is general, and can be applied to any system with information about the temporal co-occurrence of interacting agents. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

In the neotropical fringe-lipped bat, Trachops cirrhosus, social transmission of foraging behaviour is clearly demonstrated in captivity, yet its social structure in the wild remains unclear. Here, we used microsatellite-based estimates of relatedness and records of 157 individually marked adults from 106 roost captures over 6 years, to infer whether male and female T. cirrhosus have preferred co-roosting associations and whether such associations were influenced by relatedness. Using a null model that controlled for year and roosting location, we found that both male and female T. cirrhosus have preferred roosting partners, but that only females demonstrate kin-biased association. Most roosting groups (67\%) contained multiple females with one or two reproductive males. Relatedness patterns and recapture records corroborate genetic evidence for female philopatry and male dispersal. Our study adds to growing evidence that many bats demonstrate preferred roosting associations, which has the potential to influence social information transfer.},

	abstract = {The existence of discrete social clusters, or 'communities', is a common feature of social networks in human and nonhuman animals. The level of such community structure in networks is typically measured using an index of modularity, Q. While modularity quantifies the degree to which individuals associate within versus between social communities and provides a useful measure of structure in the social network, it assumes that the network has been well sampled. However, animal social network data is typically subject to sampling errors. In particular, the associations among individuals are often not sampled equally, and animal social network studies are often based on a relatively small set of observations. Here, we extend an existing framework for bootstrapping network metrics to provide a method for assessing the robustness of community assignment in social networks using a metric we call community assortativity (rcom). We use simulations to demonstrate that modularity can reliably detect the transition from random to structured associations in networks that differ in size and number of communities, while community assortativity accurately measures the level of confidence based on the detectability of associations. We then demonstrate the use of these metrics using three publicly available data sets of avian social networks. We suggest that by explicitly addressing the known limitations in sampling animal social network, this approach will facilitate more rigorous analyses of population-level structural patterns across social systems.},

A recent formalism, known as multilayer network analysis, has advanced the study of multifaceted networked systems in many disciplines. It offers novel ways to study and quantify animal behaviour through connected ‘layers’ of interactions. In this article, we review common questions in animal behaviour that can be studied using a multilayer approach, and we link these questions to specific analyses. We outline the types of behavioural data and questions that may be suitable to study using multilayer network analysis. We detail several multilayer methods, which can provide new insights into questions about animal sociality at individual, group, population and evolutionary levels of organization. We give examples for how to implement multilayer methods to demonstrate how taking a multilayer approach can alter inferences about social structure and the positions of individuals within such a structure. Finally, we discuss caveats to undertaking multilayer network analysis in the study of animal social networks, and we call attention to methodological challenges for the application of these approaches. Our aim is to instigate the study of new questions about animal sociality using the new toolbox of multilayer network analysis.},

	abstract = {Until recently, the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) was one of the most common bat species in North America. However, this species currently faces a significant threat from the emerging fungal disease white-nose syndrome (WNS). The aims of this study were to examine the population genetic structure of M. lucifugus hibernating colonies in Pennsylvania (PA) and West Virginia (WV), and to determine whether that population structure may have influenced the pattern of spread of WNS. Samples were obtained from 198 individuals from both uninfected and recently infected colonies located at the crest of the disease front. Both mitochondrial (636 bp of cytochrome oxidase I) and nuclear (8 microsatellites) loci were examined. Although no substructure was evident from nuclear DNA, female-mediated gene flow was restricted between hibernacula in western PA and the remaining colonies in eastern and central PA and WV. This mitochondrial genetic structure mirrors topographic variation across the region: 3 hibernating colonies located on the western Appalachian plateau were significantly differentiated from colonies located in the central mountainous and eastern lowland regions, suggesting reduced gene flow between these clusters of colonies. Consistent with the hypothesis that WNS is transmitted primarily through bat-to-bat contact, these same 3 hibernating colonies in westernmost PA remained WNS-free for 1-2 years after the disease had swept through the rest of the state, suggesting that female migration patterns may influence the spread of WNS across the landscape. Host dispersal and migration are fundamental parameters in disease ecology. Large-scale movements of host individuals may contribute to the spread of wildlife diseases by introducing a pathogen to naïve populations of the same species or by exposing different species to the pathogen, thereby facilitating host-jumping (reviewed by Altizer et al. 2011). Population and landscape genetic approaches have proven useful for understanding the broad-scale movements of both host and pathogen populations (Archie et al.},

	abstract = {Incomplete lineage sorting can genetically link populations long after they have diverged, and will exert a more powerful influence on larger populations. The effects of this stochastic process can easily be confounded with those of gene flow, potentially leading to inaccurate estimates of dispersal capabilities or erroneous designation of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs). We have used phylogenetic, population genetic, and coalescent methods to examine genetic structuring in large populations of a widely dispersing bat species and to test hypotheses concerning the influences of coalescent stochasticity vs. gene flow. The Mexican free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana, exhibits variation in both migratory tendency and route over its range. Observations of the species' migratory behaviour have led to the description of behaviourally and geographically defined migratory groups, with the prediction that these groups compose structured gene pools. Here, we used mtDNA sequence analyses coupled with existing information from allozyme, banding, and natural history studies to evaluate hypotheses regarding the relationship between migration and genetic structure. Analyses of molecular variance revealed no significant genetic structuring of behaviourally distinct migratory groups. Demographic analyses were consistent with population growth, although the timing of population expansion events differs between migratory and nonmigratory populations. Hypotheses concerning the role of gene flow vs. incomplete lineage sorting on these data are explored using coalescent simulations. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for coalescent stochasticity in formulating phylogeographical hypotheses, and indicates that analyses that do not take such processes into account can lead to false conclusions regarding a species' phylogeographical history. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Our heuristic strives for uniform edge lengths, and we develop it in analogy to forces in natural systems, for a simple, elegant, conceptually-intuitive, and efficient algorithm. KEY WORDS Graph drawing Force-directed placement Multi-level techniques Simulated annealing THE GRAPH-DRAWING PROBLEM A graph G = (V , E) is a set V of vertices and a set E of edges, in which an edge joins a pair of vertices.' Normally, graphs are depicted with their vertices as points in a plane and their edges as line or curve segments connecting those points. There are different styles of representation, suited to different types of graphs or different purposes of presentation. We concentrate on the most general class of graphs: undirected graphs, drawn with straight edges. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that attempts to produce aesthetically-pleasing, two-dimensional pictures of graphs by doing simplified simulations of physical systems. We are concerned with drawing undirected graphs according to some generally accepted aesthetic criteria:* 1. Distribute the vertices evenly in the frame. 2. Minimize edge crossings. 3. Make edge lengths uniform. 4. Reflect inherent symmetry. 5. Conform to the frame. Our algorithm does not explicitly strive for these goals, but does well at distributing vertices evenly, making edge lengths uniform, and reflecting symmetry. Our goals for the implementation are speed and simplicity. PREVIOUS WORK Our algorithm for drawing undirected graphs is based on the work of Eades3 which, in turn, evolved from a VLSI technique called force-directed pla{\textasciitilde}ernent.{\textasciitilde} We begin by quoting Eades' explanation of his 'metaphor':},

	abstract = {Social complexity has been invoked as a driving force shaping communicative and cognitive abilities, and brain evolution more generally. Despite progress in the conceptual understanding of societal structures, there is still a dearth of quantitative measures to capture social complexity. Here we offer a method to quantify social complexity in terms of the diversity of differentiated relationships. We illustrate our approach using data collected from Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, at ‘La Forêt des Singes’ in Rocamadour, France, as well as simulated data sets for a proof-of-concept. Based on affiliative and agonistic behavioural categories, we calculated four indices that characterize social relationships (diversity of behavioural patterns, dyadic composite sociality index, relative interaction frequency and tenor). Using cluster analyses, we identified four different relationship types: rarely interacting agonistic dyads, rarely interacting affiliative dyads, moderately frequently interacting ambivalent dyads and frequently interacting affiliative dyads. We then calculated for each individual a derived diversity score that integrates information about the number and diversity of relationships each subject maintained. At the individual level, one may be interested to identify predictors of this individual diversity score, such as age, rank or sex. At the group level, variation in the relative shares of affiliative and agonistic interactions affects the distribution of individual diversity scores more than the interaction frequency, while the omission of ambivalent relationships (i.e. a discontinuous variation in the share of affiliative or agonistic relationships) leads to greater variation in diversity scores. The number of realized relationships had only a moderate effect. Overall, this method appears to be suited to capture social complexity in terms of the diversity of relationships at the individual and group level. We suggest that this approach is applicable across different species and facilitates quantitative tests of putative drivers in brain evolution.},

Here we suggest that the building blocks of social cognition are a suite of skills, ordered roughly according to the cognitive demands they place upon individuals. These skills allow an animal to recognize others by various means; to recognize and remember other animals' relationships; and, perhaps, to attribute mental states to them. Some skills are elementary and virtually ubiquitous in the animal kingdom; others are more limited in their taxonomic distribution. We treat these skills as the targets of selection, and assume that more complex levels of social cognition evolve only when simpler methods are inadequate. As a result, more complex levels of social cognition indicate greater selective pressures in the past. The presence of each skill can be tested directly through field observations and experiments. In addition, the same methods that have been used to compare social cognition across species can also be used to measure individual differences within species and to test the hypothesis that individual differences in social cognition are linked to differences in reproductive success.},

	abstract = {When selecting feeding, hiding, or resting areas, animals face multiple decisions with different fitness consequences. To maximize efficiency, individuals can either collect personal information, or use information gathered and transmitted by other individuals (social information). Within group living species, organisms often specialize in either generating social information or using information gathered by other groups members. That is the case of the Spix’s disk-winged bat, Thyroptera tricolor. This species uses contact calls during roost finding. Social groups are composed by a mix of vocal and non-vocal individuals and those vocal roles appear to be consistent over time. Moreover, their vocal behavior can predict roost finding in natural settings, suggesting that vocal individuals are capable of generating social information that can be used by other group members. To date, however, we do not know if when presented with social information (contact calls) during roost finding, vocal individuals will make more or less use of these cues, compared to non-vocal individuals. To answer this question, we broadcast contact calls from a roost inside a flight cage to test whether vocal individuals could find a potential roost faster than non-vocal individuals when they encounter sounds that signal the presence of a roost site. Our results suggest that non-vocal individuals select roost sites based primarily on social information, whereas vocal individuals do not rely heavily on social information when deciding where to roost. This study provides the first link between vocal behavior and the use of social information during the search for roosting resources in bats. Incorporating ideas of social roles, and how individuals decide when and where to move based on the use of social information, may shed some light on these and other outstanding questions about the social lives of bats.},

	abstract = {Behavioral ecologists have devoted considerable effort to identifying the sources of variation in individual reproductive success. Much of this work has focused on the characteristics of individuals, such as their sex and rank. However, many animals live in stable social groups and the fitness of individuals depends at least in part on the outcome of their interactions with other group members. For example, in many primate species, high dominance rank enhances access to resources and reproductive success. The ability to acquire and maintain high rank often depends on the availability and effectiveness of coalitionary support. Allies may be cultivated and coalitions may be reinforced by affiliative interactions such as grooming, food sharing, and tolerance. These findings suggest that if we want to understand the selective pressures that shape the social behavior of primates, it will be profitable to broaden our focus from the characteristics of individuals to the properties of the relationships that they form with others.

In this paper, I critically review definitions and studies of social complexity in invertebrate and vertebrate societies, arguing that the concept is being used inconsistently in studies of vertebrate sociality. Group size and cohesion define one cornerstone of social complexity, but the nature and patterning of social interactions contribute more to interspecific variation in social complexity in species with individual recognition and repeated interactions. Humans provide the only example where many other unique criteria are used, and they are the only species for which intraspecific variation in social complexity has been studied in detail. While there is agreement that complex patterns emerge at the group level as a result of simple interactions and as a result of cognitive abilities, there is consensus neither on their relative importance nor on the role of specific cognitive abilities in different lineages. Moreover, aspects of reproduction and parental care have also been invoked to characterize levels of social complexity, so that no single comprehensive measure is readily available. Because even fundamental components of social complexity are difficult to compare across studies and species because of inconsistent definitions and operationalization of key social traits, I define and characterize social organization, social structure, mating system, and care system as distinct components of a social system. Based on this framework, I outline how different aspects of the evolution of social complexity are being studied and suggest questions for future research. Significance statement: Animal and human societies differ in social complexity, i.e., the number and association patterns of group members as well as the nature and patterning of their social relationships, but the dimensions of social complexity, the processes that generate it, the selective forces that engender different levels of social complexity, and the evolutionary consequences of this variation remain to be comprehensively understood.

	abstract = {Abstract: Among mammals, bats exhibit extreme variation in sociality, with some species living largely solitary lives while others form colonies of more than a million individuals. Some tropical species form groups during the day that persist throughout the year while many temperate species only gather into groups during hibernation or parturition. How groups form and then persist has now been described for a number of species, but the degree to which kinship explains patterns of association has never been quantified across species. Here, we use social network analysis and genetic data to determine the extent to which relatedness contributes to associations among individuals estimated from free-ranging animals across nine species from four families of bats. Network analysis reveals that all species show evidence of emergent social structure. Variation in the strength of the relationship between genetic relatedness and social association appears to be related to the degree of roost switching, i.e., species in which individuals change roosts frequently tend to exhibit higher levels of association among relatives. Sex-biased dispersal determines whether associations were between male or female relatives. The strength of associations among kin does not predict known occurrence of complex behaviors, such as dominance or various types of cooperation, indicating that kinship is not a prerequisite for social complexity in bats. Significance statement: The number of differentiated relationships has been proposed as a way to measure social complexity. Among primates, relationships can be differentiated on the basis of rank, age, kinship, or association. Application of this approach to other groups of mammals that vary in sociality could help reveal ecological, behavioral, or cognitive similarities and differences between species. As a first step toward this approach, we used social network analysis on long-term individual records and estimated relatedness using genetic markers for nine species of bats. We confirmed nonrandom emergent social structure in all species. Kinship was predictive of social association among individuals of the same sex in a few species, but largely independent of the occurrence of complex behaviors, such as dominance among males or cooperation among females. Complex social behavior in bats appears to require frequent interactions among a small number of individuals that roost together for multiple years.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2435.13407},
	abstract = {To make adaptive behavioural decisions, animals must acquire and process information from their natural and social environment. Reducing uncertainty regarding the actions and goals of conspecifics is especially important for group-living animals. Bats are often highly gregarious and use versatile social vocalizations to mediate social interactions. These social vocalizations encode a substantial amount of ecologically relevant information, such as individual identity, sex and kin. Decoding this information enables receivers to make informed decisions on resource allocation, mate choice, territorial defence and cooperation. Erroneous decisions on such crucial aspects of bats’ social behaviour can be costly due to reduced reproductive success or survival. Increasingly complex social interactions require social vocalizations encoding more information which, in turn, could facilitate the evolution of even more complex social interactions. Evidence for the positive correlation of social and vocal complexity is available for several taxa but is currently very limited for bats. We conducted a phylogenetic comparative analysis to link the information content encoded in bats’ social vocalizations to the complexity of their social lives, that is the level of uncertainty associated with assessing individual identity. We focused on three different vocalization types encoding individual signatures (pup isolation calls, adult contact calls and male-specific vocalizations). Information content in bit (i.e. the number of binary decisions necessary to discriminate among N individuals) was used as an estimate of vocal complexity; relevant social group size (i.e. the number of conspecifics whose identity a receiver could confuse) was used as an estimate of social complexity. Our phylogenetic comparative analysis detected a positive relationship between the information content of vocalizations and the respective relevant social group size. This relationship suggests a positive feedback loop between social and vocal complexity for bat vocalizations and highlights the importance of vocal information for negotiating fitness-relevant social decisions of bats. In conclusion, our work suggests that social complexity drives vocal complexity in bats. Future studies on other hitherto understudied taxa are necessary to establish a comprehensive theory on the multi-faceted co-evolution of sociality and communication in the animal kingdom.

	abstract = {Some nonhuman animals form adaptive long-term cooperative relationships with nonkin that seem analogous in form and function to human friendship [1–4]. However, it remains unclear how these bonds initially form, especially when they entail investments of time and energy. Theory suggests individuals can reduce the risk of exploitation by initially spreading out smaller cooperative investments across time [e.g., 5] or partners [6], then gradually escalating investments in more cooperative partnerships [7]. Despite its intuitive appeal, this raising-the-stakes model [7] has gained surprisingly scarce empirical support. Although human strangers do “raise the stakes” when making bids in cooperation games [8], there has been no clear evidence for raising the stakes during formation of social bonds in nature. Existing studies are limited to cooperative interactions with severe power asymmetries (e.g., the cleaner-client fish mutualism [9]) or snapshots of a single behavior within established relationships (grooming in primates [10–13]). Raising the stakes during relationship formation might involve escalating to more costly behaviors. For example, individuals could “test the waters” by first clustering for warmth (no cost), then conditionally grooming (low cost), and eventually providing coalitionary support (high cost). Detecting such a pattern requires introducing random strangers and measuring the emergence of natural helping behaviors that vary in costs. We performed this test by tracking the emergence of social grooming and regurgitated food donations among previously unfamiliar captive vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) over 15 months. We found compelling evidence that vampire bats selectively escalate low-cost grooming before developing higher-cost food-sharing relationships.},

In some temperate bat species, maternity groups break apart and rejoin both daily, as females depart to forage and select day roosts to use, and annually, as bats leave for and return from hibernation. Here, we investigated whether bats have persistent social preferences by testing whether relationships between dyads in a focal year could be predicted by previous years. We also hypothesized that experience influences social preferences and predicted that an individual’s age would influence its network position, while familiarity with bats of the same cohort would drive persistent social preferences. We quantified roost co-occurrence in little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) in Salmonier Nature Park, Newfoundland, Canada both within and among years. We found that roost co-occurrence patterns of previous years still had predictive value even when accounting for potential roost fidelity. However, we found no evidence that cohort familiarity or age explained any of the variation. Overall, we found long-term patterns of association in this temperate bat species that suggest levels of social complexity akin to other large mammal species.},

In natural space, we observe baboon-typical patterns of collective behaviour. By contrast, in urban space (where there are increased risks, but increased potential for high-quality food rewards), baboons show extreme flexibility in collective behaviour, with changes in spatial cohesion and association networks, travel speeds and group coordination. However, leader-follower roles remain robust across natural and urban space, with adult males having a disproportionate influence on the movement of group members. Their important role in the group's collective behaviour complements existing research and supports the management tactic employed by field rangers of curbing the movements of adult males, which indirectly deters the majority of the group from urban space. Our findings highlight both flexibility and robustness in collective behaviour when groups are presented with novel resources and heightened risks.},

In many instances individuals will make their own choices and the behaviour of the group will be a democratic integration of everyone's decision. However, in some instances it can be advantageous to follow the choice of a few individuals in the group if they have more information regarding the situation that has arisen. Here I provide early evidence that decisions about shifts in activity states in a population of bottlenose dolphin follow such a decision-making process. This unshared consensus is mediated by a non-vocal signal, which can be communicated globally within the dolphin school. These signals are emitted by individuals that tend to have more information about the behaviour of potential competitors because of their position in the social network.

	abstract = {To what degree has biology influenced and shaped the development of moral sys-tems? One way to determine the extent to which human moral systems might be the product of natural selection is to explore behaviour in other species that is analogous and perhaps homologous to our own. Many non-human primates, for example, have similar methods to humans for resolving, managing, and preventing conflicts of interests within their groups. Such methods, which include reciprocity and food sharing, reconciliation, consolation, conflict intervention, and mediation, are the very building blocks of moral systems in that they are based on and facilitate cohesion among individuals and reflect a concerted effort by community members to find shared solutions to social conflict. Furthermore, these methods of resource distribution and conflict resolution often require or make use of capacities for empathy, sympathy, and sometimes even community concern. Non-human primates in societies in which such mechanisms are present may not be exactly moral beings, but they do show signs of a sense of social regularity that-just like the norms and rules underlying human moral conduct-promotes a mutually satisfactory modus vivendi.},

	abstract = {Roads are a potential threat to bat conservation. In addition to the direct risk of collision of bats with vehicles, roads could pose a threat to bat populations as a result of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and could act as barriers to movements of bats between habitats. We performed a systematic review of the literature and conducted meta-analyses to assess the threat posed by roads to bats as a result of 1) collisions between bats and vehicles and 2) roads acting as barriers to movements of bats. Based on collated records of 1207 bat road casualties in Europe, we found that low-flying species are more prone to collisions than high-flying species, and that juveniles are more vulnerable to collisions than adults. In addition, meta-analysis identified a significant bias towards male casualties. Casualties included rare species such as Barbastella barbastellus and geographically restricted species such as Rhinolophus species. The bias towards male casualties could be indicative of greater natal philopatry or lower dispersal among females, or of sexual segregation in habitats of varying quality, i.e. females may occupy better quality habitats than males, and road density may be lower in better quality habitats. Whether or not roads act as barriers to the movement of bats depends on a complex interplay of habitat and species-specific behaviour. For example, the presence of favourable habitat for bats – notably woodland – was found in this review to be linked with significantly reduced barrier effects but a heightened risk of collision. Our data suggest that roads do pose a threat to bats. Future research should assess the contribution of traffic noise and street lighting to the barrier effect of roads. Where new road schemes are monitored by ecological practitioners, it is vital that consistent protocols are employed to ensure that bat activity can be compared before and after the road is built. Evidence from such research should be used to minimize the risks for bats of any roads built in the future, and to design safe crossing points for bats.},

Before parturition, P. pipistrellus populations were heavily skewed towards solitary males. After parturition, the sex ratio was closer to unity. Recaptures of marked bats suggested that after parturition a resident male population of P. pipistrellus is invaded by a transient female population. The sex ratios of populations of P. auritus and M. nattereri were very close to unity, both pre-and post-parturition. The numbers of recaptures of individual bats were similar for both sexes in P. auritus and slightly higher for females in M. nattereri. In the mating season (August±October), solitary male P. pipistrellus were found with small groups (1±9) of females. In contrast, in both P. auritus and M. nattereri, mixed sex groups were found pre-and post-parturition, and roosting groups in the mating season contained up to 20 females and up to 10 males. The stability of female groups in P. auritus appeared to be higher than M. nattereri and P. pipistrellus as known females were found together more frequently. These patterns are discussed with reference to the possible differences in foraging and social behaviour.},

Four purported mammalian examples-social grooming in coati, cluster position in roosting pallid bats, information exchange among greater spear-nosed bats, and blood regurgitation among vampire bats-are examined to determine if reciprocal altruism is necessary to plausibly explain each situation. Results from a computer simulation which apportions the relative selective advantage of vampire bat food sharing to kin selection and reciprocal altruism are then presented. The results demonstrate that the increase in individual survivorship due to reciprocal food sharing events in this species provides a greater increase in inclusive fitness than can be attributed to aiding relatives. This analysis suggests that reciprocal altruism can be selectively more important than kin selection when altruistic behaviors in a relatively large social group occur frequently and provide a major fitness benefit to the recipient even when that recipient is related to the donor.},

Using long-term field observations and molecular genetic techniques to identify kin relations between individuals, we show that male chimpanzees clearly prefer to affiliate and cooperate with their maternal brothers in several behavioral contexts. Despite these results, additional analyses reveal that the impact of kinship is limited; paternal brothers do not selectively affiliate and cooperate , probably because they cannot be reliably recognized, and the majority of highly affiliative and cooperative dyads are actually unrelated or distantly related. These findings add to a growing body of research that indicates that animals cooperate with each other to obtain both direct and indirect fitness benefits and that complex cooperation can occur between kin and nonkin alike.

Changes in demographics, dominance hierarchies or ecological factors, such as food availability or disease prevalence, are expected to influence decision-making processes regarding social interactions. Therefore, it should be expected that individuals show flexibility rather than stability in social behaviour over time to maximize the fitness benefits of social living. Understanding the processes that create and maintain social phenotypes requires data encompassing a range of socioecological settings and variation in intrinsic state or life-history stage or strategy. Using observational data spanning up to 19 years for some individuals, we demonstrate that multiple types of social behaviour are repeatable over the long term in wild chimpanzees, a long-lived species with complex fission-fusion societies. We controlled for temporal, ecological and demographic changes, limiting pseudo-repeatability. We conclude that chimpanzees living in natural ecological settings have relatively stable long-term social phenotypes over years that may be independent of life-history or reproductive strategies.

With the increase in popularity of social network analysis, researchers have started to look beyond the dyad to examine the role of indirect connections in animal societies. Here, I provide an overview of the new knowledge that has been uncovered by these studies. I focus on research that has addressed both the causes of social behaviours, i.e. the cognitive and genetic basis of indirect connections, as well as their consequences, i.e. the impact of indirect connections on social cohesion, information transfer, cultural practices and fitness. From these studies, it is apparent that indirect connections play an important role in animal behaviour, although future research is needed to clarify their contribution.},

In this study, we use social network analysis to examine the relationship between primate group size, total brain size, neocortex ratio and several social network metrics concerned with network cohesion. Using female grooming networks from a number of Old World monkey species, we found that neocortex size was a better predictor of network characteristics than endocranial volumes. We further found that when we controlled for group size, neocortex ratio was negatively correlated with network density, connectivity, relative clan size and proportional clan membership, while there was no effect of neocortex ratio on change in connectivity following the removal of the most central female in the network. Thus, in species with larger neocortex ratios, females generally live in more fragmented networks, belong to smaller grooming clans and are members of relatively fewer clans despite living in a closely bonded group. However, even though groups are more fragmented to begin with among species with larger neocortices, the removal of the most central individual does cause groups to fall apart, suggesting that social complexity may ultimately involve the management of highly fragmented social groups while at the same time maintaining overall social cohesion.

If so, the social attributes quantified using network statistics may themselves be personality traits. We have previously found that some social attributes of yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) may be heritable, suggesting that they are profitably viewed as reflecting individually distinctive social predispositions. Here, we asked the degree to which defensive aggression was independent of various measures of social aggression. We quantified defensive aggression when animals were live trapped and asked whether it was related to how socially tolerant marmots were. We found that although some of these social traits were epeatable, none were strongly correlated across contexts.

Networks are rarely repeatedly sampled; yet an assumption of individual consistency in social behaviour is often made when drawing conclusions about the consequences of social processes and structure. A characterization of such social phenotypes is therefore vital to understanding the significance of social network structure for individual fitness outcomes, and for understanding the evolution and ecology of individual variation in social behaviour more broadly. Here, we measured foraging associations over three winters in a large PIT-tagged population of great tits, and used a range of social network metrics to quantify individual variation in social behaviour. We then examined repeatability in social behaviour over both short (week to week) and long (year to year) timescales, and investigated variation in repeatability across age and sex classes. Social behaviours were significantly repeatable across all timescales, with the highest repeatability observed in group size choice and unweighted degree, a measure of gregariousness. By conducting randomizations to control for the spatial and temporal distribution of individuals, we further show that differences in social phenotypes were not solely explained by within-population variation in local densities, but also reflected fine-scale variation in social decision making. Our results provide rare evidence of stable social phenotypes in a wild population of animals. Such stable social phenotypes can be targets of selection and may have important fitness consequences, both for individuals and for their social-foraging associates.},

	abstract = {Consistent individual differences in social phenotypes have been observed in many animal species. Changes in demographics, dominance hierarchies or ecological factors, such as food availability or disease prevalence, are expected to influence decision-making processes regarding social interactions. Therefore, it should be expected that individuals show flexibility rather than stability in social behaviour over time to maximize the fitness benefits of social living. Understanding the processes that create and maintain social phenotypes requires data encompassing a range of socioecological settings and variation in intrinsic state or life-history stage or strategy. Using observational data spanning up to 19 years for some individuals, we demonstrate that multiple types of social behaviour are repeatable over the long term in wild chimpanzees, a long-lived species with complex fission-fusion societies. We controlled for temporal, ecological and demographic changes, limiting pseudo-repeatability. We conclude that chimpanzees living in natural ecological settings have relatively stable long-term social phenotypes over years that may be independent of life-history or reproductive strategies. Our results add to the growing body of the literature suggesting consistent individual differences in social tendencies are more likely the rule rather than the exception in group-living animals.},

	title = {Information transfer at evening bat colonies},
	abstract = {Four lines of evidence indicate that evening bats, Nycticeius humeralis, at nursery colonies in northern Missouri transfer information by following each other to feeding and roosting sites. (1) Daily estimates of insect density from five automated suction traps showed that common prey in evening bat faecal samples, small beetles and flies, occur in rich patches that persist for several days. Bats apparently respond to prey density and variability because these variables independently predict the number of trips and capture success of foraging bats. (2) Videotape records of the time and weight of bats arriving and departing from a colony indicated that adult females leave within 10 s of each other on second and subsequent foraging trips more often than expected within a night. These records also revealed that bats alternate between apparent following and leading over a summer, that unsuccessful foragers follow previously successful foragers within a night, and that the foraging success of putative followers is greater than that of unsuccessful bats which depart solitarily. (3) Radio-tagged bats often returned to foraging sites both within a night and on successive nights. Furthermore, three of 12 radio-tagged bats flew closer to another radio-tagged bat throughout a night than expected if bats foraged independently. (4) Two field experiments in which bats were excluded from their roosts for one night demonstrated that newly volant bats follow adult females to alternate roosts. The possibility that evening bats acquire information passively by monitoring echolocation signals or actively by vocal advertisement is discussed. Animals that live in groups often suffer higher rates of ectoparasite transmission (Hoogland 1979 ; Brown \& Brown 1986) and reproductive parasitism (Brown 1984 ; Brown \& Brown 1988) as well as more competition for food, mates or other critical resources than solitary individuals. Thus, in the absence of habitat limitation, group living must improve an individual's foraging efficiency, risk of predation, or care of young to offset these costs (Alexander 1974). Transfer of information about the location or quality of food patches (Ward \& Zahavi 1973) is one frequently suggested yet rarely demonstrated (Bayer 1982 ; Weatherhead 1987 ; Mock et al. 1988 ; Richner \& Marclay 1991) advantage to forming a communal roost or colony. Although information transfer has been suggested for communally roosting bats (Fleming 1982), only anecdotal data have been reported (Howell 1979 ; McCracken \& Bradbury 1981 ; Wilkinson 1985). In this study I investigate whether a temperate insecti-vorous bat, the evening bat Nycticeius humeralis, locates resources, such as feeding and roosting sites, by following individuals from a nursery colony. Most studies purporting to demonstrate information transfer in birds have described coordinated departures from a roost or colony and subsequent arrival at a feeding site, i .e .) and cliff swallows, Hirundo pyrrhonota (Brown 1986, 1988a). However, data which show that leaders alternate roles with followers are provided in only one of these studies (Brown 1986). Documenting alternation between leading and following is necessary to discriminate between information parasitism and information exchange (Galef 1991). This distinction is important because whenever more time or energy is required to locate resources independently than that required to wait and follow another forager. following will be more profitable than independent searching. Therefore, when resource patches are difficult to find, following behaviour provides net energetic benefits to participating group members 0003-3472/92/090501 4-18 \$08 .00/0},

Here we review the social learning literature that uses bats as models under the framework of Galef (2009) and Laland (2009) to examine when, where, and from whom bats are most likely to learn socially about food and other foraging behaviour. We conclude that evidence exists for bats learning about novel foods from other bats, learning how to handle such food from other bats, and that bats often learn these ways when uncertain about the quality of different foods available. There is also evidence that young bats learn about new foods from their mothers, and that adult bats learn from other adult bats, even other bat species. However, whether bats more likely to learn from familiar individuals or learn about specific foraging areas from others is less established and warrants further research. We also conclude that phyllostomid bats present the best evidence of social learning about food and suggest future research, including investigating the possibility of nonhuman culture, focus on this diverse group.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Checking that models adequately represent data is an essential component of applied statistical inference. Ecologists increasingly use hierarchical Bayesian statistical models in their research. The appeal of this modeling paradigm is undeniable, as researchers can build and fit models that embody complex ecological processes while simultaneously accounting for observation error. However, ecologists tend to be less focused on checking model assumptions and assessing potential lack of fit when applying Bayesian methods than when applying more traditional modes of inference such as maximum likelihood. There are also multiple ways of assessing the fit of Bayesian models, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Bayesian P values are relatively easy to compute, but are well known to be conservative, producing P values biased toward 0.5. Alternatively, lesser known approaches to model checking, such as prior predictive checks, cross-validation probability integral transforms, and pivot discrepancy measures may produce more accurate characterizations of goodness-of-fit but are not as well known to ecologists. In addition, a suite of visual and targeted diagnostics can be used to examine violations of different model assumptions and lack of fit at different levels of the modeling hierarchy, and to check for residual temporal or spatial autocorrelation. In this review, we synthesize existing literature to guide ecologists through the many available options for Bayesian model checking. We illustrate methods and procedures with several ecological case studies including (1) analysis of simulated spa-tiotemporal count data, (2) N-mixture models for estimating abundance of sea otters from an aircraft, and (3) hidden Markov modeling to describe attendance patterns of California sea lion mothers on a rookery. We find that commonly used procedures based on posterior predictive P values detect extreme model inadequacy, but often do not detect more subtle cases of lack of fit. Tests based on cross-validation and pivot discrepancy measures (including the "sampled predictive P value") appear to be better suited to model checking and to have better overall statistical performance. We conclude that model checking is necessary to ensure that scientific inference is well founded. As an essential component of scientific discovery, it should accompany most Bayesian analyses presented in the literature.},

Despite the increased interest in animal group decision making, there is a lack of experimental field studies that investigate how animals with conflicting information make group decisions. In particular, no field studies have considered the influence of fission-fusion behaviour (temporary splitting into subgroups) on group decisions. We studied group decision making in two wild Bechstein's bat colonies, which are fission-fusion societies of stable in dividual composition. Since they frequently switch communal roosts, colony members must regularly make group decisions over where to roost. In the two-field experiments, we provided marked individuals with conflicting information about the suitability of potential roosts. We investigated whether conflicting information led to group decisions that followed a 'unanimous' or a 'majority' rule, or increased colony fission. Individual behaviour suggests that bats considered both their own information and the behaviour of others when deciding where to roost. Group decisions about communal roosts reflected the information available to a majority of the bats roosting together, but conflicting information led to an increased fission in one colony. Our results suggest that fission-fusion societies allow individuals to avoid majority decisions that are not in their favour. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

Previous experiments show that wild T. cirrhosus brought into the laboratory are flexible in their ability to reverse the associations they form between prey cues and prey quality [2]. Here we asked how this flexibility can be achieved in nature. We quantified the rate at which bats learned to associate the calls of a poisonous toad species with palatable prey by placing bats in three groups: (a) social learning, in which a bat inexperienced with the novel association was allowed to observe an experienced bat; (b) social facilitation, in which two inexperienced bats were presented with the experimental task together; and (c) trial-and-error, in which a single inexperienced bat was presented with the experimental task alone. In the social-learning group, bats rapidly acquired the novel association in an average of 5.3 trials. In the social-facilitation and trial-and-error groups, most bats did not approach the call of the poisonous species after 100 trials. Thus, once acquired, novel associations between prey cue and prey quality could spread rapidly through the bat population by cultural transmission. This is the first case to document predator social learning of an acoustic prey cue. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Dawn swarming is a set of behavioural displays observed in many such bats before they enter the roost. It is suggested that this behaviour plays a role in transferring information about the roost position. However this phenomenon had not been explored in detail. Based on qualitative and quantitative description of behaviour we suggest its potential function. Using field-based video-recordings of swarming sessions made on maternity colonies of Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri), we constructed ethograms which revealed remarkably similar behavioural sequences among individuals. For more than two hours prior to sunrise, individual flybys in front of the roost entrance predominated, followed by landings and leaps, which preceded the final entering of the roost. Interestingly, no obvious peak of behavioural activity was found at any particular time during swarming but a wave-like pattern was observed. We suggest that individuals are swarming in close proximity to the roosting tree with some purpose, most probably serving as a beacon for other group members and thus marking the current location of the roost. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.},

	abstract = {AbstractData collection biases are a persistent issue for studies of social networks. This issue has been particularly important in animal social network analysis (ASNA), where data are often unevenly sampled and such biases may potentially lead to incorrect inferences about animal social behaviour.Here, we address the issue by developing a Bayesian model, which not only estimates network structure but also explicitly accounts for sampling and censoring biases.Using a set of simulation experiments designed to reflect various sampling and observational biases encountered in real‐world scenarios, we systematically validate our model and evaluate its performance relative to other common ASNA methodologies. By accounting for differences in node‐level censoring (i.e. individual variation in undetected ties), our model permits the recovery of true latent social connections, even under a wide range of conditions where some key individuals are intermittently unobserved.Our model outperformed all other existing approaches and accurately captured network structure, as well as individual‐level and dyad‐level effects. Antithetically, permutation‐based and simple linear regression approaches performed the worst across many conditions. These results highlight the advantages of generative network models for ASNA, as they offer greater flexibility, robustness and adaptability to real‐world data complexities. Our findings underscore the importance of generative models that jointly estimate network structure and measurement biases typical in empirical studies of animal social behaviour.},

Despite the important role that personality and behavioral syndromes play in the ecology and dynamics of wildlife populations, a disconnect between basic and applied research realms continues. While the concept of animal personalities and their role in ecology and evolution is increasingly embraced in the animal behavior, ecology, and evolutionary biology literature, it is less represented in applied wildlife management and conservation literature. We identify 10 research foci, often considered the domain of applied wildlife management and conservation, summarize examples of how these research domains may be inﬂuenced by personality and behavioral syndromes, and outline potential implications.

	abstract = {Social network analysis provides a useful lens through which to view the structure of animal societies, and as a result its use is increasingly widespread. One challenge that many studies of animal social networks face is dealing with limited sample sizes, which introduces the potential for a high level of uncertainty in estimating the rates of association or interaction between individuals. We present a method based on Bayesian inference to incorporate uncertainty into network analyses. We test the reliability of this method at capturing both local and global properties of simulated networks, and compare it to a recently suggested method based on bootstrapping. Our results suggest that Bayesian inference can provide useful information about the underlying certainty in an observed network. When networks are well sampled, observed networks approach the real underlying social structure. However, when sampling is sparse, Bayesian inferred networks can provide realistic uncertainty estimates around edge weights. We also suggest a potential method for estimating the reliability of an observed network given the amount of sampling performed. This paper highlights how relatively simple procedures can be used to estimate uncertainty and reliability in studies using animal social network analysis.},

                  Increasing urbanization and recreational activities around and within biodiversity hotspots require an understanding of how to reduce the impacts of human disturbance on more than a single species; however, we lack a general framework to study multiple species. One approach is to expand on knowledge about the theory of anti‐predator behaviour to understand and predict how different species might respond to humans.
                
                
                  We reviewed the literature and found that only 21\% of studies that used a behavioural approach to study human disturbance focused on multiple species. These studies identified a number of potential predictive variables.
                
                
                  We developed a simulation model that investigates interspecific variation in different parameters of disturbance with variation in human visitation. We found that fitness‐related responses, such as the quantity of food consumed by a species, are relatively sensitive to the distance at which animals detect humans, the frequency of disturbance by humans and the interaction of these factors, but are less sensitive to other characteristics.
                
                
                  We examined avian alert distance (the distance animals first orientated to an approaching threat, a proxy for detection distance) across 150 species, controlling for phylogenetic effects. We found that larger species had greater alert distances than smaller species, which could increase local spatial and temporal limitations on suitable habitat with increasing human visitation.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis and applications
                    . Our results suggest that body size could be a potential predictor of responses to human disturbance across species, and could be used by managers to make conservation decisions regarding levels of human visitation to a protected site. We suggest that three things are essential to develop predictive models of how different species will respond to human disturbance. First, multiple indicators of disturbance should be studied to select those with lower intraspecific variation for a given study system. Secondly, the species‐specific nature of responses should be identified. Thirdly, life history, natural history and other correlates with these species‐specific responses must be assessed.},

                  Animal social networks are often constructed from point estimates of edge weights. In many contexts, edge weights are inferred from observational data, and the uncertainty around estimates can be affected by various factors. Though this has been acknowledged in previous work, methods that explicitly quantify uncertainty in edge weights have not yet been widely adopted and remain undeveloped for many common types of data. Furthermore, existing methods are unable to cope with some of the complexities often found in observational data, and do not propagate uncertainty in edge weights to subsequent statistical analyses.
                
                
                  
                    We introduce a unified Bayesian framework for modelling social networks based on observational data. This framework, which we call
                    BISoN
                    , can accommodate many common types of observational social data, can capture confounds and model effects at the level of observations and is fully compatible with popular methods used in social network analysis.
                  
                
                
                  We show how the framework can be applied to common types of data and how various types of downstream statistical analyses can be performed, including non‐random association tests and regressions on network properties.
                
                
                  Our framework opens up the opportunity to test new types of hypotheses, make full use of observational datasets, and increase the reliability of scientific inferences. We have made both an R package and example R scripts available to enable adoption of the framework.},

                  Automated analysis of bioacoustic recordings using machine learning (ML) methods has the potential to greatly scale biodiversity monitoring efforts. The use of ML for high‐stakes applications, such as conservation and scientific research, demands a data‐centric approach with a focus on selecting and utilizing carefully annotated and curated evaluation and training data that are relevant and representative. Creating annotated bioacoustic datasets presents a number of challenges, such as managing large collections of recordings with associated metadata, developing flexible annotation tools that can accommodate the diverse range of vocalization profiles of different organisms and addressing the scarcity of expert annotators.
                
                
                  We present Whombat, a user‐friendly, browser‐based interface for managing audio recordings and annotation projects, with several visualization, exploration and annotation tools. It enables users to quickly annotate, review, and share annotations, as well as visualize and evaluate a set of machine learning predictions on a dataset. The tool facilitates an iterative workflow where user annotations and machine learning predictions feedback to enhance model performance and annotation quality.
                
                
                  We demonstrate the flexibility of Whombat by showcasing two distinct use cases: (1) a project aimed at enhancing automated UK bat call identification at the Bat Conservation Trust (BCT), and (2) a collaborative effort among the USDA Forest Service and Oregon State University researchers exploring bioacoustic applications and extending automated avian classification models in the Pacific Northwest, USA.

                  Data collection biases are a persistent issue for studies of social networks. This issue has been particularly important in animal social network analysis (ASNA), where data are often unevenly sampled and such biases may potentially lead to incorrect inferences about animal social behaviour.
                
                
                  Here, we address the issue by developing a Bayesian model, which not only estimates network structure but also explicitly accounts for sampling and censoring biases.
                
                
                  Using a set of simulation experiments designed to reflect various sampling and observational biases encountered in real‐world scenarios, we systematically validate our model and evaluate its performance relative to other common ASNA methodologies. By accounting for differences in node‐level censoring (i.e. individual variation in undetected ties), our model permits the recovery of true latent social connections, even under a wide range of conditions where some key individuals are intermittently unobserved.
                
                
                  Our model outperformed all other existing approaches and accurately captured network structure, as well as individual‐level and dyad‐level effects. Antithetically, permutation‐based and simple linear regression approaches performed the worst across many conditions. These results highlight the advantages of generative network models for ASNA, as they offer greater flexibility, robustness and adaptability to real‐world data complexities. Our findings underscore the importance of generative models that jointly estimate network structure and measurement biases typical in empirical studies of animal social behaviour.},

	abstract = {The interconnecting links between individuals in an animal social network are often defined by discrete, directed behaviours, but where these are difficult to observe, a network link (edge) may instead be defined by individuals sharing a space at the same time, which can then be used to infer a social association. The method by which these associations are defined should be informed by the biological significance of edges, and therefore often vary between studies. Identifying an appropriate measure of association remains a challenge to behavioural ecologists. Here, we use automatically recorded feeder visit data from four bird systems to compare three methods to identify a social association: (1) strict time-window, (2) co-occurrence in a group, and (3) arrival-time. We tested the similarity of the resulting networks by comparing the repeatability and sensitivity of individuals’ social traits (network degree, strength, betweenness). We found that networks constructed using different methods but applying similar, ecologically relevant definitions of associations based on individuals’ spatio-temporal co-occurrence, showed similar characteristics. Our findings suggest that the different methods to construct animal social networks are comparable, but result in subtle differences driven by species biology and feeder design. We urge researchers to carefully evaluate the ecological context of their study systems when making methodological decisions. Specifically, researchers in ecology and evolution should carefully consider the biological relevance of an edge in animal social networks, and the implications of adopting different definitions.},

	abstract = {The role of bats in the enzootic cycle of Lyme disease and relapsing fever-causing bacteria is a matter of speculation. In Canada, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss) is the genospecies that is responsible for most cases of Lyme disease in humans. In this study, we determined if big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, have been exposed to spirochetes from the genus Borrelia. We collected serum from 31 bats and tested them for the presence of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We detected cross-reactive antibodies to Borrelia spp. in 14 of 31 bats. We conﬁrmed the ELISA data using a commercial immunoblot assay. Pooled sera from ELISA-positive bats also cross-reacted with Borrelia antigens coated on the immunoblot strips, whereas pooled sera from ELISA-negative bats did not bind to Borrelia spp. antigens. Furthermore, to identify if bat ectoparasites, such as mites, can carry Borrelia spp., we analyzed DNA from 142 bat ectoparasites that were collected between 2003 and 2019. We detected DNA for the Borrelia burgdorferi ﬂaB gene in one bat mite, Spinturnix americanus. The low detection rate of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in bat ectoparasites suggests that bats are not reservoirs of this bacterium. Data from this study also raises intriguing questions about Borrelia infections in bats, including the role of humoral immunity and the ability of bats to be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. This study can lead to more sampling eﬀorts and controlled laboratory studies to identify if bats can be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi and the role of bat ectoparasites, such as S. americanus, in the transmission of this spirochete. Furthermore, we outlined reagents that can be used to adapt ELISA kits and immunoblot strips for use with bat sera.},

	abstract = {White-nose syndrome is a skin disease of bats caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Pd has devastated populations of some bat species in North America, where environmental reservoirs of the fungus are considered a threat to the persistence of bat populations. However, long-term patterns of Pd environmental persistence in North American hibernacula are unknown. We swabbed hibernacula walls 11 years after the invasion of Pd into Maritime Canada in 2011. This is the first study to examine the persistence of Pd in North American hibernacula {\textgreater}7 years after the first documentation of Pd at a site. The proportion of hibernacula wall swabs with viable Pd decreased over time, with 40.6\% of wall swabs positive (n = 32) in 2012, 35.0\% (n = 40) in 2015, and 1.7\% (n = 120) in 2022. In early winter 2022, 41.18\% (n = 17) of bats (Myotis lucifugus, M. septentrionalis, and Perimyotis subflavus) were Pd-positive compared to 6.67\% (n = 15) in late winter, a low prevalence and the opposite pattern compared to the first 4 years after Pd invasion to sites. Our results suggest that Pd loads in the environment naturally decrease to low or undetectable levels over time in our study region. Since attempts to reduce environmental reservoirs have a high likelihood of negative nontarget effects on hibernacula ecosystems, and a low likelihood of completely eradicating Pd, actions to reduce environmental reservoirs in hibernacula should consider deprioritizing sites where Pd has been present {\textgreater}10 years. We urge the collection of further data across hibernacula sites with varied geochemistry, microclimates, organic matter availability, timing of Pd arrival, and surviving bat colony sizes. This will allow a more comprehensive assessment of this strategy.},
